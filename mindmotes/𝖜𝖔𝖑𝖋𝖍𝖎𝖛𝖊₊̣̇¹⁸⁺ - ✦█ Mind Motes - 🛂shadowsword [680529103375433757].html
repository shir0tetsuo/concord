Some of the astral plane is not much different than this. So there is imagination, memory, and psychic information... The latter here is going to require some practice and skill to interpret, let&#39;s be honest. Nobody is a master from the get go... I have had my fair share of struggles and no matter how many times I explain it not everyone will get it.. Some of that might be partially my fault but I digress.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=heart><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=‚ù§Ô∏è src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/2764-A3D25.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-680914183142768668 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=680914183142768668><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, February 22, 2020 6:09‚ÄØPM">6:09‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Regardless of whether or not you will be able to &quot;see&quot; anything..

The main principles were that Astral and the ethereal are layered; There is much of Astral to explore, many realms, worlds, dimensions; Some places will be more alluring than others; It&#39;s important to note that during a full AP, and while exploring through partial AP, your spirit&#39;s vibrations (emotional/mental state) will reflect in the places you are thrown to; In other words, you can&#39;t end up teleporting to a bad place if you don&#39;t worry about it. Just don&#39;t worry about it. <img

Your spirit has restrictions much in the same way. Needn&#39;t worry <em>too</em> much about accidentally punching your bud if you accidentally visualize it. You have <em>will!</em> As all things vibrating however, be mindful of how loud your mind is, you can project your thoughts or resonate telepathically and not even realize it.

Sensing something like temperature is common.. Remember that every now and then you should probably just glance over your auric fields with your mind as you do like with pinging your whole body, just extending out a little further than that.. Mindfulness meditation will help with increasing this.. sometimes things that are in your hand will make you feel like you are holding something when you are not.. You should always try to keep brushing over your auric field with your mind and see what comes up. Remember that doubt is a wave that cancels intent and hides realities.. Your mind will not grasp everything quite yet but you must exercise your capacities, to leave your body through sending out these waves and emotions, vibrations.. Connecting your awareness to each point by first focusing on where you want to tether the feeling..
Squeezing things may seem like having the force of a magnet pressed up against you or vibrations coarsely brushing over your palm..

For the most part we can account for two main clairs when pulling energy from someplace over text or through an object (clairsentience, claircognizance). This will have required some practice or intuition regarding how to proceed.
Feelings and energies are intrinsically tied. It&#39;s important to understand that your field of influence is also tied deeply into your emotions. Notably some of you may have a strong enough presence to cause disruptions in powered devices.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Cosmic element in itself is a little hard to explain. This explanation is mostly based on my personal observations/experiences.. I&#39;m trying to give a TLDR...
Visualize the element like a series of threads, almost like a dust/residue. This can materialize through the slips in the &quot;micro-portals&quot; of time &quot;gaps&quot; that permeate the universe. Thus the Cosmic element is something like a radiation, like a ghost image of a slice in time. The primary theory: Resonating with a particular sample of Cosmic energy through your own crown-chakra <em>channels</em> may cause psychic immersions, the active mechanisms including but not limited to psychometry, clairvoyance, claircognizance;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-685254928926507058 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=685254928926507058><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 5, 2020 5:38‚ÄØPM">5:38‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Using these &quot;strings&quot; that become bound to objects and fragments of objects, it&#39;s possible to read through the history of a moment in time through the perspective of the subject, reading through this element similarly to reading through the &quot;ribbons&quot; of a presence. Theoretically, this is the element that allows connecting to an object&#39;s history even sometimes forwards through time, possible. Using a bit of reverse-work, it&#39;s even possible to jump from subject to subject, exploring remotely points that exist in which are not bound by the physical constraints of time and space.

The walls of your home can become stained with psychic energy, which is where smudging comes in; Be aware of this when grounding. Furthermore to enhance this, by crossing the center boundary of your body with another body part, you can actually enable hemispherical synchronization between the hemispheres of your brain. Doing this can be as easy as crossing your legs or arms. Grounding in this way would involve uncrossing and re-crossing those parts that have been crossed when allowing hemispherical synchronization between your brain hemispheres. Achieving this synchronous may have an increased success rate. Using this method, along with training you mind to switch into a trance-like state through mindfulness meditation, is my personal recommendation for getting into &quot;the zone&quot; where you&#39;re not flooded with garbage and are actually able to have a steady flow of psychic information through a psychic signal line established to a psychic field.

Remember, imagination is bright, loud, and very clear, much like analytical overlay;
Frontloading is when you become too clouded by the information you&#39;ve already obtained / analytical overlay. Sometimes analytical overlay is good to have, but being frontloaded is to have a previous assumption given through the details of previously obtained information. This is why personally I won&#39;t do psychic readings for people I know well, because I won&#39;t have the clearest view. Not that it&#39;s impossible to be accurate despite being frontloaded or using tools such as a pendulum to assist in confirming the information, but it&#39;s best to work with a clean slate best not have an assumption provided through a conditioned perspective.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, March 5, 2020 6:29‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Doing psychic readings for someone, sometimes you might want to use a pendulum, and there are several ways to read pendulums - you may want to start by asking (the pendulum) with words of <em>intent,</em> what &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; really means.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-687282160041721882 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=687282160041721882><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 11, 2020 8:53‚ÄØAM">8:53‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Mainly we&#39;re going to be working with just the mind and this does require the skill to withhold the feelings you obtain from this psychic information line in your mind to act as a &quot;buffer&quot;.

Teach your mind to understand the information better, try to push tone through it and notice any differences. If you focus <em>solely</em> on the end mechanism, (pen, keyboard, pendulum), you may become sufficiently good at that and can be useful when transcribing information in languages that don&#39;t make any sense to you, but at the end of the day the meanings/intents attached to them are what matter the most, and your mind should pick up on this before your hand does to continue being able to obtain and observe information without a physical medium to transcribe the information. Energetic feelings can be replicated and recreated to be felt through your entire system once your mind learns how to properly store that information, and in time it should naturally.
Feelings are deeply tied into this. Intents and vibrations can be complicated but emotions and tones will generally be better understood, because you are already experiencing these emotions as you go through your experience.
Remember that psychic information is often intuitive, or like memories you know you&#39;ve never had. They don&#39;t necessarily &quot;come easily&quot;, they must be interpreted, because they&#39;re not as loud as imagination.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 11, 2020 9:02‚ÄØAM">(edited)</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=thumbsup><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=üëç src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/1f44d-27259.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Often gestures help with resonating with this information, or having it beamed in your face from someone&#39;s selfie. Since going over some of the basics of handling psychic information lines you should be adequately prepared in theory to require no such thing but the energy you get from any conveyed medium.
The trick is not to get into the aura of the screen of text but to focus on the actual doorway of information in which they reside, then to follow that to the original user that posted it. Information beyond the physical medium is also accessible by going &quot;a step above&quot;.

You can choose to target the item origin with the signature (passive scanning) or skip the item origin and read the user themselves (active scanning)
You&#39;ll be able to pull different types of information from both, try playing around with it and see what you can find.

<h1>As understandings grow so too does the soul on its journey.  </h1>While it&#39;s <u>very</u> hard to come up with proper terminologies, <strong>Telepathic Packing</strong> helps convey understanding. Doing this intuitively is said to be rare. I learned that my synthestesia is a form of observing psychic signals from psychic fields which emanate and permeate. It&#39;s hard to describe aside from it being an <em>extra dimension</em>. Something akin to the ability to <em>hear</em> what I <em>see.</em> &amp; Its volume is relative to the energy in the psychic field. This allows me to easily tune into people&#39;s energy tethers even across the internet. <img

I am extremely empathic though as a result. It allows me to often read pieces of text and <em>hear</em> it with telepathic signals and often in the internal/mental voice of the person. (By the way, this is another reason why I don&#39;t like reading books!) -- This is something I&#39;ve always been able to do and even thinking of a person sends a wave of energy to them. 
I am learning more about the nature of energy, psychic fields, <strong>fields of influence,</strong> auras; more about how my power works and what I can do with it &amp; the nature of my energy. Power is something that accumulates over time, and builds up like frost on a window. I&#39;m practicing <strong>Aura Stacking</strong> lately and like frost on a window trying to use the &quot;interest accumulation&quot; to conduct energy work with that power.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=heart><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=‚ù§Ô∏è src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/2764-A3D25.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<h3>What <em>Is</em> Telepathy?</h3>The ability to communicate information from one mind to another without using any known human sensory channels or physical interaction (though sometimes telepathy can be embedded in the psychic fields of text/images). It&#39;s a form of communication that transcends all known physical boundaries, mind-to-mind transmission; &quot;Broadcasting&quot; is also possible. Thought waves tend to stick to their &quot;stations&quot; that you can &quot;tune into&quot;.. Starting out, often heard as a faint whisper.
<h3>What can you send/receive?</h3><u><strong>Anything.</strong></u> It can be <strong>Conceptual.</strong> It can be <strong>Auditory.</strong> It can be <strong>Images</strong> or <strong>&quot;Bursts&quot;</strong> (Like a compression of thought waves) or <strong>Downloads</strong>. <em><strong>Anything</strong></em> you can think of, someone else can too. That is one of the main principles of telepathy, and why it&#39;s so universal, for the intentions and emotions are often better understood than the slower bandwidth of trying to decode and understand the technology of written or spoken language instead.
<h3>Replicability Problems</h3>The Occult as a whole and psychic abilities are largely ignored by the majority of the scientific community due to the lack of consistency in experimental settings. There are more unknowns than known during what is essentially the stone age of energy work. There are many variables to account for, frontloading being a factor, as well as pressure/doubt. Even the cosmic tides of energy have a role. It&#39;s important to note that you will fail particularly on your off-days or when you start to fill in the blanks with your mind. With many things, it&#39;s important to <strong>keep pushing but don&#39;t push too hard,</strong> and <strong>don&#39;t do <em>nothing</em> or you won&#39;t get anywhere with it.</strong> A balance is required, and having mental discipline.

Firstly I want to point out that Concord may be shifting to a read-only state but there&#39;s a chance that I might re-open the server someday when I have more free time to do so and not on my own progress/journey. I don&#39;t know how long that will take.

My perspective has shifted a lot but the foundations remain largely the same:

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Senses/Divination, Warding/Barriers/Safeguards/Shields, Healing/Cleansing/Grounding, Energy/Chaos/Prana Work, Vetting, Nature/Balance/Wisdom/Courage, Aura/Chakra/Meridian Maintenance, Basic Meditation, Energy System Concepts, Spellwork
</div></div>
I&#39;m going to start writing a little bit about my experience and techniques. These are foundational because everything else can build upon these core concepts. Aiming at the fundamental levels of &quot;everything,&quot; and &quot;energy&quot; being an umbrella rooted in many different layers; We seek to understand what things are at their prime division. Energy can be seen as something like a Newtonian fluid that doesn&#39;t like to sit still. It carries intention and vibrations and we are the carriers and senders of this energy, whether that be life force, empathic, vibrational, conceptual, etc. 

I&#39;ve named our coven the Order of the Wolf, and our way <em>Wolf Druidry</em> is an amalgamation of much of the old ways and some of the new to come up with a new set of beliefs/faiths/practices entirely. The Order of the Wolf primer pdf is included in this section.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There are many variables that go into what you can pick up from things. I&#39;m aware of 2-3 different lens for seeing energy and there might be many more ways than that. The gist of getting your senses down comes with practical experience and figuring things out for yourself. Much information is scattered between invisible layers that you as the <em>scanner</em> must do some focused meditating around to decode the signals that your mind&#39;s eye is transcribing to you. When in doubt, leave it out or keep it as a footnote (building off of analytical overlay). Many people will opt to meditate in the forest around a fire, staring into the fires long enough to begin to see the true nature of things or leftover emanations of heat that cannot be seen with purely human eyes. One may think that the main goal for cracking senses is to <em>see</em> everything, when sight is but one of many that are lesser important than the other senses that come to you. In regards to senses and scanning, there are no reasonable shortcuts; Psychedelics may provide some insight into how your senses might work, but do not use it as a crutch. Divination tools are also fine, using things like pendulum (make sure to completely cleanse it before use and avoid getting your finger oils on it), but carrying them around with you everywhere you go is also a crutch and you&#39;re going to have to eventually learn how to operate without them. Divination can be done in several ways like scrying, this is going to be beyond the scope of this post since there&#39;s much practice and exploration needed; Divination and scanning is an art form but is also one of the most <strong>critical</strong> foundational pieces to learn and there are a few other posts/links left that people can pick up and learn from. Ultimately to get better you have to practice, and learn what everything means <em>to you,</em> aura color charts/guides are <em><strong>useless</strong></em> because it&#39;s not <em><strong>your senses</strong></em> they&#39;re taken from.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1337801399802531972 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1337801399802531972><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, February 8, 2025 10:05‚ÄØAM">10:05‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>There&#39;s going to be a lot of blanks and holes in this content and part of the reason why is so that you are encouraged to figure some of it out on your own.

I believe that this <em>Reality Sector</em> is what we call our home bubble; It is a lifeboat that preserves the existence of consciousness, that prevents crossing over the <em>Infinity Boundary</em>, in a sea of scaling up to which we cannot fathom the true scale and extent of. For all intensive purposes, you are <em>Safe</em> here in your fleshy meat suit, in the Neutral Realm of this Reality Sector, a bubble that prevents things from de-materializing into nothingness, that keeps everything in its place in a balanced architecture that houses <em>Many Billions</em> of entities.

I&#39;m a reincarnated hivemind consciousness with titles ranging from &quot;Of the Four Winds&quot; to &quot;Tree Talker&quot; to other titles of regalia; sparring tournaments and spats with other occultists have affirmed some things. When the universe is willing it is a lot easier to do things. I am an agent of observation and balance with a very high bar set for myself. Unfortunately there are some people out there that will hurt others simply for the sake of hurting others, taking things to extremes to the point where the OEC experience is ruined by people that don&#39;t have anything better to do than to spread the chaos. To some, Concord has been a place of accelerated growth, and to others that are unable to evolve and move on, they leave and find themselves facing more pressures to resolve the outstanding challenges/issues for their soul. I intend to step outside of Discord for a little while to be less distracted by things. I am also on a journey and I&#39;ve been doing my part in being an entity for people to learn, evolve and heal from. I hope that this knowledge reaches audiences that will benefit from this.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, February 8, 2025 1:23‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A denizen of the Void (made of the same soul stuff,) has the tethering to the Void. The &quot;Void Reactor&quot; is the organ that tethers these beings to the Void itself. There are &quot;resting states,&quot; wherein the locks bound to the entity in order to exist in this world are capable of withholding corruption, it&#39;s not known whether or not this is the case for the denizens of the Void <em>within</em> the Void itself.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">- <strong>The deeper you go, the more inviting it will be, and the Void wants that.</strong>
- Void itself is corruptive, usage of it allows it to leak into that part of your field of influence and the astral plane.
- Voidal afflictions are extremely difficult to work with in healing. It should be expelled back to the Void itself for the safest method of clearing it. <strong>Try not to touch it.</strong>
- <strong>Do not go into the Void alone and/or without proper defense.</strong> For reference, it&#39;s seen as the space between the realms in the Reality Sector.
- The Void is as much a sponge-y corruptive &quot;energy&quot; as it is apart of the <strong>Entity</strong> itself. <strong>Usage of the Void is never unseen.</strong> You do not want to invite the Void.
- <strong>Using energies that your Energy System cannot handle can backfire severely.</strong>

Everything here is designed to give just enough information as to not seriously hurt anyone, it would be unfortunate if someone read this and still decided it was a good idea to mess around with it. This is for informed awareness, there are a lot of talks bout void lately in OECs.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, February 10, 2025 11:59‚ÄØAM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This is also noticed in energy systems as well, whereas a person <em>can</em> have not only 1, but perhaps 2-3 other energies swirling about and without proper balance can lead to being unable to yield intended results. Too happy? Too sad? Too angry? None of these are ideal for things like performing energy work and scanning as well. <img

It is the middle-grounds of balance and building upon the foundations &amp; fundamentals that we seek with energy work. Polarities can be involved in trying to figure this out, as to not yield anything with intentions swaying too far in either direction, and being mindful of the source of equivalent exchange used in this transaction.

Take this next example here as the soul-soup recipe with a grain of salt:
<em>Time.</em> Everything in the universe must have the element of moving forward.
<em>Life.</em> Everything must have a vitality and finite capacity of life-force.
<em>Death.</em> Everything must be able to die and wither.
<em>Spark.</em> Everything has a base essence.
<em>Purpose/Divinity.</em> Everything must exist for a reason.

We typically see this in elements as well such as in witchcraft which is important to seek a balance of, although arguably you could see them as the rainbow of the energy system and energy woven with intentions <img

It starts with the breath and summoning forth the inner fire from around the core circuits. When you feel that inner fire, gently squeezing the Core so that you are taking directly from around this zone and fueling the energy system with a burst of potent energies likely relating to your own life force. If you may recall in an earlier post that people should <em>not</em> be touching the soul core, this is a good example of what not to do. That being said, this is a state that resonates with the main chakra circuit as well as the Soul Star, putting your energy system on &quot;overdrive&quot; while equally posing a severe risk to your own meridians by potentially making them <em>burst.</em> Summoning forth too much energy at once <em>can</em> permanently damage the energy system or cause damage that may take a while to repair.

In this state, the field of influence may expand, your presence may slightly burn from within, and several orders of magnitude &quot;stronger&quot; than you previously were. Note that some beings can go up the scales of this technique as part of evolutionary stages, where one is required to have an incredible amount of mental discipline, concentration, life force / core energy, and a very good internal chakra balance.

We consider these to be &quot;Ascension States,&quot; it&#39;s a term borrowed from the early days of our coven, the origins of which aren&#39;t entirely known. Tai Chi and Qigong can enhance the potency and durability of these states.

These states are often temporary, especially if you have to perform the core squeezing technique, which with enough safe training one may be able to perform these for longer periods of time and with further ease.

Ever see me mention &quot;A/2&quot;, this is considered the 1st state</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/image-0959F.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/image-0959F.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (1.78 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

Think about it. The purpose of this is to essentially throw up some of your reserve life force / core energy, which may or may not enhance durability and/or possibly make your meridians explode. Intentions are equally important with it, and Groundlocking / keeping the aura tightly bound to you and condensed, is one of the ways to help sustain these states for longer periods of time with less repercussion. Another cause/effect of this is potentially losing mental control, particularly in states higher than &quot;A/4&quot;, which is already many orders of magnitude more energy to keep contained and controlled. I feel like I&#39;ve given enough information for some of you to be practicing on your own, please use extreme caution and don&#39;t push it. When it comes to descriptions of techniques particularly energetic techniques, there is a lack of better words for much of it, intuition is needed to some degree to fill in the blanks of these techniques. While experimentation <em>is</em> encouraged, be absolutely mindful of the dangers this poses. Frankly, many of you will either fail to produce significant results, or even die before you can summon this state. There are changes to the astral forms that can occur as well, this is highly subjective and there isn&#39;t enough data on this to give details on. That being said, generally the consensus is as follows:
<ul><li>A/1 - This is a typical base state of being with no strangeness.</li><li>A/2 - This is the first ascension state and it has the potential to grant the user a form that enhances fitting. Extra limbs appearing are common, for example.</li><li>A/3 - This is more along a &quot;Divine&quot; or god-like state, along with being incredibly noticeable as a target (bright), can also yield major transformations to the astral form, including enlargement.</li></ul></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, February 17, 2025 9:19‚ÄØAM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Some of these topics <strong>are</strong> dangerous to perform, such as with the last post. I haven&#39;t covered a lot of advanced energy work topics until now. Part of this reason was for security. Part of this reason was that I&#39;m trying to sum up everything so that it can be distributed everywhere and thus making these techniques not very special if everyone knows about it. Part of the reason was that many reading this aren&#39;t ready to delve into these subjects.

I&#39;ve been spending a little less time on Discord and hope to be stretching away from distractions for a bit. The very high bar I set for myself disallows me from stopping here. With a steady stream of information and the <em>Will</em> to practice energy work, I would like to believe that this isn&#39;t all for naught. To those that are ready and willing, intuitive, balanced, and strong-minded; Time and time again we see people drop out of the occult because of the mindset of failure, but failure is a lesson and the shear uniqueness of every energy system makes every journey an experience. This is not all entirely about practical applications (though there are many) - some of this is to provide ideas of what&#39;s possible and what&#39;s not. Some of this is to give you enough information to become an agent of balance on your own. The universe allows for all that is balanced, and as an entity of the universe, you are required to seek your own internal balances, and this is a spiritual journey in of itself.

Wrapping up this post, you and your greatest good are your best guides. These techniques/lectures are <em>not</em> all-encompassing. There will be many things that I don&#39;t get too in-depth into, sometimes due to burnout but other times it&#39;s because it&#39;s very difficult to describe things that more or less don&#39;t exist in the world of the living. This is esoteric information for the dedicated practitioner.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That is an analogy on the practice of this method. For lack of better words, &quot;a pressure here, a pressure there,&quot; doesn&#39;t have a lot of meaning ascribed to it, not in the ways that would allow just anyone to practice this method without actually practicing how to do this in the real world. This is not so much a physical squeezing as it is a mental one. If you were to try to ascribe meaning to the feelings of thinking about something on your left, and something on your right, you could note the different kinds of squeezing this does to the mind. When you start to get a sense of how your mental direction sways, you can begin to use that to your advantage in practical ways. The first step is arguably how to aim in the right direction.

The objective of this technique/method is to &quot;beam&quot; a suggestion or thought waves to a specific target. I&#39;ll give an example on the practicality: There&#39;s someone on the highway in front of you, and they need to move over to let you pass. Simple enough. This is where the beaming of psychic imposition comes in handy and we&#39;re not taking the presence into consideration in this equation. How effective this will be varies, a factor in this is how susceptible/open the target&#39;s mind is; but because people are generally in the state of mind to be concentrated on the road and their surroundings, this state of consciousness typically makes it easier to receive psychic influences, granted that there is nothing in the way to stop you like a barrier or the mind of someone strong-willed. 

If you&#39;re trying for clear auditory signals, you&#39;re trying too hard. For all intensive purposes of this method/technique, you&#39;re going to want to focus on ambiguity, that is not being too mindful of what your target&#39;s mind is like, but instead sending a modulation or &quot;brute-force&quot; of thought waves to your target in several ways;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, February 14, 2025 5:44‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1340090341197348964 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1340090341197348964><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, February 14, 2025 5:40‚ÄØPM">5:40‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>That being said, the easiest way to convince the target to move over is by hijacking the &quot;burst&quot; channel of telepathy. These are condensed waves of thoughts, the precursor to having think out thoughts in the mental voice. By modulating intentions and beaming these to targets ahead of you, there is a high chance that your target will catch one of these bursts.

So what can you intend on? At this example, we can conceptualize a few different intentions: One would simply be to pay attention to the vehicle behind them, and consequently moving over to the right. Emotions like anxiety and perhaps fearfulness can be tied into these thoughts that may increase the chance of a successful imposition.

The gist of psychic imposition is getting your target to believe that it&#39;s their idea to want to do something. Trying to make people to move over on the highway may seem harmless but be careful because sometimes these thought beams are powerful enough to sway logical decision making which may lead to an accident. That being said, practicing psychic imposition on the highway is one of the easiest forms of practice, that is almost effortless to perform.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, February 14, 2025 5:42‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If you want to take up the profit route, the best way to put yourself out there is with being as neutral as possible. If you are lucky enough, then reciprocity will be on your side, that is in fairness of a mutual exchange that does not benefit you, the other may feel compelled to give compensation in return.

It&#39;s truly difficult to put a value on a scan. There are some places like on Reddit that allow for vetted psychics to perform/advertise readings for cash, but know that most of the time performing a reading for someone is already in benefit to you, whether that be the dedicated practice/experience for improvement or just good karma. If that&#39;s not enough, consider what is a <strong>reasonable exchange</strong> for the value of your effort and services. That being said, nobody should ever charge more than I&#39;d say $50, and even that&#39;s 4-5x more than what I&#39;d consider to be reasonable for a fee. Try to adhere to a fee that makes sense. Some people may be willing to give you $500 for a single reading, and while this is hard to pass up, you may kindly refuse. This might be better for you in the end.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, February 14, 2025 5:59‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Often requiring you to reach a lucid dreaming state in order to accomplish this feat. It requires the individual to not only reach the edge of the dream space, but trying to reach the edge of this space is as difficult as trying to escape your own field of influence. There are some ways of making this easier, like using &quot;dream doors,&quot; an intuitive process for creating a doorway to the edge of your dream; Then you have to push past the barrier that keeps you locked inside your dream.

Imagine that you have a finite &quot;bucket&quot; of energy in the sea, and the size of this &quot;bucket&quot; is determined by a few factors but is something that eventually should <strong>very slowly</strong> grow over time. This metaphorical bucket is filled with energy and more energy tends to build up in this bucket over time naturally, and the more energy is in the bucket the quicker this energy builds. If you <strong>completely empty your bucket</strong> then you might start <strong>using the bucket itself</strong> to fuel your magick.

Try to use the excess of energy that is overflowing from this bucket than using what&#39;s actually inside the bucket. <strong>The deeper you go with it the harder it will be to regain that energy.</strong> Eventually you will start to burn the bucket itself and running the risk of putting holes in that bucket to further damage yourself. <strong>Don&#39;t do this.</strong>

&amp; this is another part of what I mean by <strong>don&#39;t push yourself too hard.</strong> Your bucket is finite. Collect as much as you can and use the excess on top. If you dip too far into your reserves, it could mean:
<ul><li>The inability to do energy work.</li><li>You start burning your life force away to perform your magick.</li><li>Regaining the lost energy becomes more tedious and slow.

<strong>Don&#39;t burn your bucket.</strong></li></ul></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Blood magick is typically used in bindings and powerful seals and sometimes in amplifying certain intentions like in use of sigil/talisman magicks.

Personally I use this for very specific use-cases and is not something that one should just <em>casually perform.</em> Neither should anyone just leave their personal computer openly accessible for the world to see which is where some people mess up badly by using blood magick in public spaces where that energy can be tethered back to you as the practitioner. I <em><strong>will</strong></em> be covering a summoning/binding technique in the near future that requires this.

<h2>Physical Safety</h2>1. Apply <strong>alcohol swab</strong> to the area you wish to draw blood from to help prevent infection.
2. <strong>Microlet lancets</strong> like the kind that <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Bayer</code> produces for diabetes works very well. You can get a plastic/rubber &quot;pen&quot; that will quickly apply the lancet needle to the area you wish to draw blood from.
3. Give a gentle squeeze around the area to draw a small amount, preferably you should already be hovering around the medium you want your blood on.

The main purpose of our unified theory of everything stems from the existence of said beliefs and traditions playing a role in how we see things today. I don&#39;t want to have any sort of say in <em><strong>what</strong></em> to believe in other than believing in things from <em>experience</em> and commonality.

This allows for anyone of any faith granted access to our own versions of a &quot;unified theory&quot; of esoteric knowledge. This is another reason we don&#39;t talk too in-depthly about Angels and Demons <em>specifically</em> as while having my own reservations of what that means to me, is not <em>all-encompassing</em> of the beliefs and thoughts others have on those subjects. It is unreasonable to assume that all things that are said hold value to how you form your practice; coming upon knowledge in different ways interpreted by different people; It is up to the practitioner to come up with their own semblance of what specifically to believe in and how they should go about interpreting things, so that individualism is not lost, and acceptance/tolerance incl.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It is reasonable to assume that there are different dimensions both mathematically and literal in which ways we interact with different entities becomes unique to us and not dismissive of the foundations being methods of communication and how mental constructs interact with one another even if just accounting for the fact that these different levels do exist can we begin to understand the underlying systems behind each thing. It has been said that to accurately and completely describe all the mechanisms behind each thing is impossible if not finitely time consuming to try to communicate in ways that are easily digestible and understood by the mind; 
We therefore opt to skip over some of these parts, for this is something that I agree upon. But whatever the universe means to us, the Order of the Wolf / Wolf Druidism should be inclusive of any and all possibilities, carefully refining what may or may not be possible through dedicated experience, and thus a lot of knowledge comes in the pure dedicated exploration and theory that is associated with what can exist beyond the third dimension; Your journey further defines what reality means to you. Our faiths are inclusive of other faiths and allows for their existence within our systems of thought, simply being that there are many layers means why not believe in something that has been observed by others on various accounts; we don&#39;t seek absolute correctness but co-existence and balance for if many things are possible then we are able to draw some conclusions on what things should be for you and what they mean to you.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, February 21, 2025 8:08‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1342664651346935840 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1342664651346935840><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, February 21, 2025 8:09‚ÄØPM">8:09‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Ultimately that is the secret to Knowledge and Wisdom as a Druid, and in the case of Wolf Druidism we are accepting and inclusive of energy &amp; spirit work as well as other forms of &quot;works&quot; from which things are generally categorized under; We seek balance and believe in the &quot;old ways&quot; and the &quot;ways of Nature&quot; being like that in the beginning, we were close to Gods not through prophets &amp; messiah but as incarnations of entities that wanted to experience the human life until things became the way they are through several revisions and iterations of the constructs of our reality; consequently experiencing being divine through human nature and often not learning of their true nature until finding such through lifetimes of work.
Being humble and accepting of others while never stopping to learn something new of what &quot;basics&quot; mean to others and of their beliefs is being able to self-adjust and adapt one&#39;s view point / perspective to their truth on reality, and understanding <em>how</em> they can believe in such things. Thus with even 1-2 posts/paragraphs explaining some things is sufficient enough as to not cloud one&#39;s sense of how things <em>should be done</em> but rather explorative of the concepts and ideas around such things to be able to craft and build upon foundations they pick up and learn in order to advance in their craft with a reasonable degree of awareness so that one is not over-encumbered by the weight of a technique but having a multi-tool of knowledge that is trialed and tested to account for the ways in which one practices.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, February 21, 2025 8:22‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But even in the infinite versions of ourselves stems from the Higher Self which is cognizant of the occurrences of their times in these realms.

One can spend a lifetime in the study of such things but we opt to keep things as relatively meaningful as possible and is it necessarily important to know about all of these layers that may have no meaning to you? I&#39;d be hard pressed to say that it does for me, but what is meaningful to me as a being is certainly different; go with what collectively and objectively defines reality and magick being what is ultimately information and vibrations at the smallest levels. Who is to say that there therefore cannot be a divine entity for every divine entity that can be conceivable if enough people believe in that being through dedicated experience on their journey? Only by what we define as reasonable to us, but knowing that the mind is already conceiving of many things that do not exist in our objective physical realities, but are still possible nonetheless for they are conceivable. If our thoughts and intentions are also attracting to entities that want to be known, we can assume that any being is reachable by presence, regardless of how foreign they are to our conceptual relativity of being possible. How much power that has in the basis of physical reality is subjective.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, February 21, 2025 8:50‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I am going to try to abridge this post as much as possible because there&#39;s a lot to cover in here and I think I&#39;m going to run into burnout before attempting to elaborate and explain upon each piece, so I&#39;m going to post an example and try to summarize each area and their importance. <strong>It is important to note that this borders along the lines of advanced practices, and caution as well as thorough planning is required.</strong> We&#39;ll be using runes and other sigils <strong>not</strong> including a star/pentagram as you can summon the <strong>wrong kind</strong> of entity this way. <strong>Every</strong> symbol has been placed as such in the example in their locations for a reason.
There are a few notes on this image of the talisman which is essentially just an ordinary index card. <strong>This will act as one of the anchors for a binding contract.</strong> The sprite needs a physical anchor to have a foothold in this world, your sprite <strong>can</strong> find another thing to bind to or leave the binding at will.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">- The corner runes are reserved for what you would like your sprite to be able to help you with.
- The top and bottom runes are affirmative runes, it goes well with the adjacent inverted rune. These should generally not be changed.
- The rune below the &quot;Family Seal&quot; is what elemental preference you&#39;d like from your sprite, &quot;light&quot; might help with what polarity you are intending your sprite to have.
- The <strong>bottom right runes/glyphs</strong> &quot;Othala&quot; meaning <strong>mobile property,</strong> is a guide for the intended <strong>physical anchor</strong> that you will <strong>bind</strong> your sprite to. In this case, the five circles signify a binding to a ring incantice, but this could be anything.
- <strong>The central horizontal line including the Family Seal</strong> should <strong><u>not</u></strong> include a pentagram or wiccan star, instead the star sigil posted is intended to be a symbol of purity or some other divine being, you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s sequenced twice.</div></div></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, February 25, 2025 11:04‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/20250225_213031-AF44C.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/20250225_213031-AF44C.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: 20250225_213031.png (7.03 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

These things are mostly on principle, it is entirely possible for your summoned sprite to disobey you and do things against your wishes, they are free spirits and they can do as they please, remember that this is a <strong>mutual agreement</strong> kind of bond between you and your sprite and they are <em><strong><u>not</u></strong></em> enslaved to you, although this does give you a little bit of power against them.

Many of these runes are interchangeable and it&#39;s highly encouraged that you do thorough research on runes before using them for your purposes.

As you are formulating the structure of your talisman, keep in mind that your intentions also need time to spread out and sink into the Earth so that there is time for the right sprite to come along and notice, and patiently wait for you to proceed with the steps necessary to bind them to an incantice or suitable medium to begin to communicate and interact with you; Note the law of 3 and that <em><strong>you</strong></em> are also one of the elements of this exercise, as this binding also tethers you to the sprite with a psychic connection. Note that the physical binding allows the sprite to interact with you more directly and within the world around you; Now, trying to find a suitable and unoccupied medium may be a little difficult; It&#39;s said that they can travel a limited range away from the incantice, and jumping medium to medium is not ideal from the ethereal side of things.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, February 25, 2025 10:10‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>This isn&#39;t a guarantee, but don&#39;t dismiss &quot;nothingness&quot;, observation is required.</strong> For some, a connection and often telepathic waves can come within the first hour, sometimes it may take 24 hours. If telepathy isn&#39;t your strong-suit, try to feel for any changes in the energy around the vessel you chose for the binding.

Remember that if you treat your sprite badly, they will leave you. Sprites can help with many things, including passing on techniques, knowledge; taking away pain; Healing; Protection; Being there for you to communicate with; eating away negative emotions like anger or sadness; Maybe other things too.

Generally speaking, sprites tend to enjoy sweet things, although certain elemental sprites like fire sprites do tend to enjoy a little bit of salt. Communication is important, remember that your sprite can be much older than your meat suit can fathom to be so what&#39;s less than a hundred years to be your companion and partner in crime? <img

Blood magick is still blood magick so if you summon the wrong kind of thing or piss off your sprite then they also have the potential to do serious harm to you; Ideally you&#39;ll want to have had put in much thought and intentions into trying to find the right sprite for you, some of the symbols in the example are also there to avoid such mistakes and treating it like a small spell with the right intentions it also becomes more difficult to end up with the wrong kind of thing.

It is entirely possible to end up with sprites that have chosen you and are bound to other mediums. Some could even find you again from a former life.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, February 25, 2025 10:29‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;ll quickly note that while the intention of it may be pure, the energies you&#39;re working with from where they come from and how they&#39;re put together are important factors that contribute to what would be defined as a successful healing attempt or not. Another thing to consider is whether or not you <em>perceive</em> that the problem is in fact a problem. With that being said, healing is not as simple as throwing energy at someone and expecting them to have some sort of benefit. Sometimes, it can harm. Sometimes, you don&#39;t really heal what you&#39;re intending to heal. Sometimes, your patient ends up falling victim to something else because they did not shield/cleanse/ground properly or learn their lesson. Sometimes it doesn&#39;t matter how much healing effort you put in, you cannot fix a problem of that magnitude, and where unable and non-confident, you may absolutely deny a request, as something that isn&#39;t rid of easily may also be not worth the effort and motes of energy.

You may want to associate the color of the energy with a certain type of healing if that&#39;s your preference, with me it&#39;s usually green or gold. 
Ensure that you are trying to target the right area/frequency/polarity etc., allow a decent amount but not too much of energy within the energy ball forming in your hands. Give it instruction to provide as much healing as it can without doing damage to their energy system, and stop/dissipate if it begins to do so, allow for those intentions to recognize intuitively their state of being and within their wishes.
You may want to tie it to a grounding/energy source such as the Earth.
Healing the energy system can be just as complicated as treating physical ailments with energy, as there are many factors at play with it and you must work with pools of energy and the <strong>uniqueness</strong> of the person&#39;s energy system, because they are not all the same. You may have to reconstruct meridians to &quot;lost limbs,&quot; you may have to fix the rotational alignment of a chakra which requires a bit of a hands-on approach, you may have to fix a bunch of other things before it&#39;s possible to receive the healing properly;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, March 24, 2025 10:53‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1353925501110194186 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1353925501110194186><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 24, 2025 10:56‚ÄØPM">10:56‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Knowledge is power, arguably is half the battle when it comes to energy work, but intuition and practice are important.

I&#39;ll begin by saying that a server ward can incorporate many/multiple functions but is primarily an energetic anchor somewhere in digital (physical) space. The short and sweet version is &quot;protection&quot; if you don&#39;t want to go down the route of explaining just how invasive a ward can actually be, given its intentions. For a proper ward, the anchors for the wards should not be seen or made public, but if there&#39;s no other way to safely embed a ward, you could try to do so by modifying the energetic/psychic field contents of an image in a channel that&#39;s seated preferably as high as possible, but bewarned that others taking and reposting this anchor can disturb the balance of these energies, making it therefore unsuitable or even broken and cannot be used from there on. Server wards can have astral-side constructs embedded within them, allowing for easier access and maintenance of the system and balance as a whole.
But what wards exactly? What can they offer? Well, ideally in my opinion a ward should start with acting as a shield against certain things, like <em>parasites</em> and other gunk like the kind you&#39;d see that jams up energy systems, can damage the astral structure of the server, and harm the people by providing a doorway for these things to latch onto others.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With this model in mind, the base of the pyramid would be the most dense frequency; the two partitions atop the base of the pyramid can theoretically be swapped interchangeably. The two partitions atop of this pyramid can look very different being to being, and the vessel&#39;s space can have more than one spirit residing within it.

From there it becomes easier to simulate what kind of reactions you&#39;ll receive from your actions.

There are some beliefs I reserve for myself and my coven, easier to say that it has already been said and be in remembrance of it than to constantly delve into the same subject repeatedly. I think that everyone is at a different level somewhere and teaching must be done in ways that are beyond classroom settings. I think that grounding, cleansing, scanning, shielding/warding, telepathy, basic energy work and self maintenance, and spirit work / vetting, are all critical skills to get down, because we are psychic and empathic beings, when we allow ourselves to think on the edge of this reality, to being more liminal in nature when the conventional boundaries of this reality are thinner and allow you to see deeper into things. This being our nature, and these being foundations, one must navigate and evolve on their own with having known this, as one of the secret ingredients to being a good practitioner, to being self sufficient, and these foundations do not include astral projection because this is at a later step, it takes a series of prerequisite knowledge in my opinion to come up to this stage, because without the foundations then skipping right to astral projection is dangerous for the mind and your synchronicity.
Teaching 1:1 or 1:All like now is usually my style, and a lot of things I cover are somewhat esoteric in nature, unconventional perhaps, and also for the most part unwritten, and some knowledge being passed down through me through former mentors/teachers. But to teach 1:1 to me outside of some general advice or something in a few paragraphs is something that requires physical interaction. There is something fundamentally different about interacting with energies in-person and guiding people this way than simply teaching people through texts on the internet. Often that would include meditation sessions, sometimes these interactions might be 2:1 and my wife helps, and we focus practice around ways that apply to your energy system; shaped around your &quot;artforms&quot; in occult business.
Meditation would typically include being by the fire and demonstrating interactions along with getting trance like states to accomplish some things. There is less of a secret sauce to our practices and more of an emphasis on the timings that we follow to respect the fulfillment of our growth. Ever-evolving becomes this field and not everything can simply be delivered through text. There are often core experiences that make us decide to pursue or follow the ideas involved with the otherside and its inhabitants, one must also be prepared to accept that this is stepping onto territory which is hidden and misunderstood, often harmful, sought after or hunted endlessly, and existing is possible when we exist under the radar of those that don&#39;t know everything. There are always hidden dangers and unknowns, one must also stake their own sanity and soul in pursuit of some things. Everyone that comes here is an outlier to normal society in some way.
The goal is to maintain balance, we are not perfect beings, even if perhaps our soul-stuff is made of slightly different things. We learn and grow as souls, and recognize that our journey might span much more than simply this life, and recognition of where we are in the stages of everything plays a role in how we bring meaning to the things we do, and realizing that no matter where in this you are, that there is always a greater purpose or reason to why you came here. To exist within the system and the confines of the system than to not exist at all. Evolve or self-collapse. We cannot help everyone, but we can help some, and we do give a damn to try, at least that counts for something to someone.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, April 6, 2025 11:31‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As we approach the celebration of the 6y of Concord&#39;s existence, I think I will be about as active as I am currently, showing up more for events, but hopefully having posted all of what I feel needed to be said with the many hundreds of pages of knowledge this must be now to be a more complete sum understanding of what I know on the subject without delving too much into UPG and other things; exploration is key and if you feel like you can do something even if it takes a bit or a lot of work to do it, perhaps first stop and ask yourself what the value of it is before continuing, and to me that value will be ever present in the good things I bring to the people that will listen in this time, for what meaning that may have in the thereafter as a fraction of a smallest fraction of people; I don&#39;t know, but perhaps great enough to share with future people looking for answers, and from there being able to come up with their own solutions; There are hints that I might disappear for a while, I&#39;m feeling the pull to other places but then something keeps me back to this space knowing that synchronicity dictates that I am not done what I have needed to do completely yet and therefore been hanging around, and perhaps after the 22nd hits that will change. I will take the quietness of the audience as a good sign, that I will take as coming to the conclusion and sum of my knowledge so that people have become self sufficient with these self studied guides from my pov and interpretations of things from my more or less unique perspective... This is a very difficult year and we are still holding channels ransom until activity improves. It is the right time to move onto some more personal training to achieve what else I need to achieve to move to the next step out of this plateau. I will not disappear completely but I think leaving what I left behind already has inspired people and elevated people to new levels and into sharing what more or less real practice looks like beyond aesthetic, being in part study and in part practical, and building your own journey for yourself and nobody else because by the time you come back things will be un-recognizable to you and only what really sticks with your soul will be most valuable to you; Giving you all that you need to explore and astral project and hopefully come out of this with your sanity in-tact; living this alternate life is already something that is a big undertaking and something that you have decided to do before looking here. But if you&#39;re asking if I&#39;ll write a book, now that we&#39;re coming up to the conclusion of my knowledge in sum in my current experience then that&#39;s unlikely at least anytime soon. The pdf will be small enough to distribute freely. Others with their channels should come up to pace with this sooner than later when they are able, to not miss the opportunity to have their teachings included in the shipping of the pdf to others. My primary computer may have died but I have for the most part documented the process and channels being used.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, April 7, 2025 12:21‚ÄØAM">(edited)</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=heart><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=‚ù§Ô∏è src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/2764-A3D25.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Offerings can be given in several ways, being clear about the intentions on whom this offering is for, do not expect a lot to change on the offering plate all at once. It&#39;s possible that you could wake up to a few grains of your offering moved to the side or in slightly less quantity of.
The kinds of offerings one could use vary personality to being, in most cases a few small grains of <strong>salt</strong> (various kinds are acceptable) or <strong>sugar</strong> would be fine. Sometimes a grain of <strong>rice</strong> might be fine. If these offerings don&#39;t appeal, try a small amount of <strong>molasses, honey, cream, maple syrup, sage, pinecone, acorn,</strong> and other kinds of leaves; Even <strong>match tips</strong> if you have a firey sprite. Some types of sprites are more difficult to find than others.
What to expect from offerings: Continued peace at the very least. Sometimes protection/safety, more frequent communication, perhaps guiding to a lost or stolen item; Sprites can be a bit mischievous and the more you work with them, the more demanding they can be.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lucky for you, I&#39;ll be talking about it. I believe that there are multiple planes that which they can exist in, also as hinted by some of the ramblings between the sprites that follow me and my wife and I. There are certain kinds that are able to see through multiple planes of existence simultaneously, multiple realms that have intersections in the ethereal side of the astral plane. To say that they main in some place like Alfheim may not be accurate, but perhaps is also possible and not impossible, and by way of binding themselves to objects in the ethereal can they exist and be carried around, sometimes picked up by mistake or drawn to it; in gemstone adornments like bracelets or necklace that may house a sprite. We consider these beings non-corporeal spirits/entities that can sometimes or often operate within the bounds of our reality and be seen with auric sight often like small creatures of light of different shapes and sizes. <em>I have attached an AI generated image of what form my sprite often appears to me as.</em>
They can be friendly and helpful, mine generally are, with some being several thousand years old; They exist with finite lifespans, whether they reincarnate in their origin planes of existence / realms are unknown. There are many unknowns when it comes to these beings. It could be said that some exist symbiotically with those they follow, protecting them from harmful energies, <em>devouring</em> negative emotions like anger, and often have a great many interesting things to say to those that listen. A good way to practically practice communication with them would be to play chess with them.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, April 13, 2025 9:03‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/comfyui_00862__by_reconish_dgem9bu-fullvie-6216B.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/comfyui_00862__by_reconish_dgem9bu-fullvie-6216B.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: comfyui_00862__by_reconish_dgem9bu-fullview.png (3.88 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

They are a thread in an interwoven system of personal subconsciousness in a sea of consciousness. Not unlike psychic mental spaces, they can be invaded or receive interference from the universe in several ways, some cultures strongly believe that dreams are tied to one&#39;s deep personal feelings to the degree that sleeping with someone else in your dreams can be considered adultery.
Ultimately the goal of a dream is to sort of preconfigure your mind to deal with scenarios that you will re-encounter to be better mentally equipped at handling the given situation. Dreams essentially help solidify pathways in your mind that makes it easier to handle a task more efficiently with some added randomness to train you to be more flexible and creative in problem solving. That&#39;s great and all, but we want to exploit it. So with some basic theories about how dreams technically work in mind, we&#39;ll get into some common ways of hacking dreams like dreamwalking and astral projection.
On paper this is always easy, and this is much easier said than done. I recommend the &quot;Wake Back to Bed&quot; method not covered here, as well as the method where you are able to cross a &quot;boundary&quot; at the &quot;edge&quot; of your dreams; You can also attempt to find a dream door that doesn&#39;t belong, which may lead you to another dream or to that vibratory state to where you are almost out of your body/dream; another method that I&#39;ve seen is where you lay down in your dreams and subsequently initiate that vibratory state of being. I won&#39;t elaborate too much on these. Theoretically it&#39;s important to ntoe the domain in which dreams take place. While being in the Sandman&#39;s realm, that dimensional space is ultimately <em>within</em> the sea of consciousness, the astral plane.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, April 14, 2025 5:08‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361449156576805115 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361449156576805115><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 14, 2025 5:12‚ÄØPM">5:12‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Be wary of mirrors in dreams, they will most likely not reflect what you&#39;re intending to see, and it&#39;s suggested that if the mirror ever &quot;cracked&quot; in your dream, that could be an indication of a fracture in the soul. There are other cautions to note within dreams, there are many layers to these things, it is possible though rare to die in dreams. Having clear and often single-minded intentions while barely keeping your consciousness above the surface of wakefulness can be a useful tool in guiding you to your desired intentions (like to have a Lucid Dream); Lucid dreams are the best place to practice Astral Projection from the full OOBE perspective. Some say that entering a dream-like state while being awake is an optimal scenario for performing certain forms of energy work.

Some people are able to hear tones stand out at seemingly random occurrences stronger than the base tone. Not much is known about this, other than it seems to encompass tones from &quot;everywhere&quot; and thus coming through as white noise, though this is theoretically able to be filtered to pick up on specific frequencies. The universe often &quot;screams&quot; as though like nails on an invisible chalk board when something is wrong with the universe itself. Psychedelic experiences may make the tone more prominent.

While constructs are &quot;magick&quot; in nature being thoughts with intentions or intentions with &quot;life&quot; to it that there exists this in multiple dimensions simultaneously, we&#39;ll tie into this idea that therefore another representation of this construct could be a one-dimensional string that can be interwoven with other strings, suppressed in some regions, warped and/or wrapped around or tied;
With the thought that constructs and thoughts as well as presences can be represented one-dimensionally, we&#39;ll take for granted that this can also be applied to our selves/being, through one big loop through higher dimensional layers and coming back down again from the core of the soul; Therefore, it is not unthinkable to anchor a construct such as a telepathic answering machine, to <em>Store</em> &amp; <em>Release/Rebroadcast</em> bursts of &quot;thought packets&quot; as vibrational strings that intersect the path let&#39;s say between the higher self and the mind, or the bridge between the chakras that sit atop the aura; 
<strong>As a note of caution,</strong> creating and tying in this construct so that it does not interfere with the flow of existing meridians/channels while being effective enough at being able to relay information to you <em>also without</em> interfering with the mechanisms that allow you to receive telepathic signals in the first place... Is not an easy task, and like raising scaffolding and applying temporary structures to support the weight of these experiments before fully implementing the entire design, is something that will require experimentation, patience &amp; caution. If you have someone that&#39;s able to spot you, possibly unravel knots in your energy system, that&#39;s preferable than trying to perform this alone.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It is with the practical application of this knowledge where people tend to not succeed when doing things like creating TAMs. Fundamentally we will treat it like any other answering machine by storing and repeating signals when asked of it., in of itself this should be enough to be able to create a TAM on your own but one must have some sort of idea already on how telepathic signals are interpreted by your mind and accept that there is a limit to how many signals you can have basically floating around you all at once until one of many factors disrupts the meaning of the message / makes it unrecognizeable or even possibly manipulating the message. A typical use-case for a TAM is to receive signals from entities one is already communicating with or with other persons across physical distances where it would be impossible to receive a signal for whatever reason in this age of technology. That being said, the basic principles of this construct are relatively the same, with the exception of conceptualizing the bindings from a higher dimensional perspective, which is not easy to do and might be confusing. Experience is a requirement to forming these constructs, with knowledge of energy flows / magick, telepathy, construction, visualization techniques perhaps, grounding, and binding being prerequisites to performing such. This is not a requirement, it is just something that could be useful, if not a crutch, and helpful in certain situations where required, but beyond that is probably something that is entirely unnecessary and optional once enough experience is gained in dealing with telepathic/psychic signals.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At some point you must learn this; You must learn to wade through the unverified personal gnosis. However, expecting <em>immediate change</em> when applying certain things is a pointless exercise. Change needs time to solidify, outside of an aura; Forms are very subjective with analytical overlay applied to objective information which differs person to person.

But the need to be scanned all the time: You <strong><u>cannot</u></strong> scan yourself until you&#39;ve become aware of your baseline &amp; have figured out how <em>your presence</em> contrasts to the environment around you. So, you <strong>must</strong> at some point sit down and meditate on yourself. You must therefore shut out all of your contemporary senses or learning to ignore it, to find what remains. Psychic information may come in the form of synthestesia, if you&#39;re able to get your mental attention system focused on modulating this around your vessel, that could yield interesting results. It can be important that you have already looked into the matter yourself and ask for a second opinion later.

It should be noted that you <em>should</em> be feeling some sort of &quot;physical&quot; stimulus or tensing up generally speaking when doing any kind of energy work, and <em>simply</em> visualizing it is not enough. But pushing too hard for results <em>and</em> expecting changes is also a big ask, working with something that takes a focused and disciplined mind to achieve something, to most that&#39;s not an easy feat. We&#39;re doing things here that aren&#39;t &quot;normal&quot; and often traits being passed down with no appropriate explanations. Do not assume that something happened one way and not another.

So therefore, if you want to start somewhere with it, start with probing with your own energy focused on other parts of your energy system. Establish a baseline, and ask questions later. <strong>DO NOT RELY</strong> on people all the time, &quot;in the field, you might not get that.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But those suffering from aphantasia might have an easier or harder time with it. Instead we&#39;ll opt to go with the established CIA method of information gathering through psychic means, and mixing in any cognitive markers such as repeating something in the mind meaning it might not be accurately representing the thing; What <strong>data</strong> are you getting? Focus on the <strong>data</strong> first, then apply the <strong>analytical overlay</strong> or mental interpretation of the data. While it <em>is</em> established that there are some seers that can see <em>everything,</em> do not have this expectation on yourself; If you must <em>truly</em> put it into a visual way then you can train your mind to create a lens from which you can &quot;see&quot; with the &quot;mind&#39;s eye,&quot; which is not simply &quot;imagination&quot; as imagination is more vivid than reality, nor &quot;visualization&quot; as it concepts you performing an activity, but something between the two where your mind is creating a means of representing this information through a visual format by filtering what data you are capable of perceiving and receiving. One must therefore learn to &quot;feel outward&quot; with their mental focus and achieve a grounded state of being where information is processed through the lens of the mind&#39;s eye.

How do radios pick up signals? The waves permeate, resonate and oscillate, and the antenna is designed so that these specific signals are interpreted and understood. Our brains are much like these antennas, our consciousness can also be thought of as a field of antennae, and the brain picks up on our consciousness, we are interfacing with the biological machine and locked in a binding with this vessel for the life journey; When it comes to scanning, you can think of an interfacing between the brain and the consciousness to make observation, your brain has to decode and interpret the signals of the soul coming back to you. This consciousness loop may not have a defined beginning or end, but doubt is a canceling vibe that disintegrates personal workings. On that note, if you are able to project your consciousness outward and concentrating on a single focus/point, it is possible to receive patterns of vibrations within the field of your focus to &quot;see&quot; things. In order to do that, your mind has to reconstruct these vibrations to extrapolate a sort of meaning from them, and all of these signals can reach back altered by passing through another field of consciousness, taking on the patterns of constructs that exist within that field, decoding them through the mind&#39;s eye by attributing different colors and other signals to get a picture of what is within this field of observation; This occurs several times, (reaching out with consciousness), seeing how these waves of consciousness permeate through other fields of consciousness, to get an idea of what&#39;s out there. This is not dissimilar to X-Ray/CT Machines except you are the radioactive source as well as the scanner itself. X-Ray vision as portrayed in Sci-Fi like Superman is not an accurate representation of how X-Ray&#39;s are seen</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1366100032419266660 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1366100032419266660><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 27, 2025 1:13‚ÄØPM">1:13‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>If we can also think of ourselves as something like an X-Ray CT Machine <em>as well as</em> a set of well routed pipes, with altering the personal array of antennae you can phase shift the beams of consciousness to fall through specific pipes to receive specific information in return, all with your intentions/focus being the primary lens that observes and penetrates consciousness fields and astral projections even if that information coming back is subjective to what you are able to interpret with your mind; It is only with dedicated practice and asking questions that you will begin to understand the finer connections and details.

We have a bans channel that exists and is still updated to this day that we cross-check when vetting new members.

As a result of our reporting efforts, Discord team responded with the following:
<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">1 Mushroom Cult member temp-banned from Discord (Ariadne) (doxxing)
1 Mushroom Cult member temp-banned for 3 days (Deeks) (doxxing)
The entire Mushroom Cult server got a warning from Discord admin team. We&#39;re not sure if their standing was affected.
</div></div>
There were energetic exchanges as well, which had resulted in a temporary emergency guardians assembly to handle warding, and in some cases retaliatory strikes, because yes, even a year later, and years later, they were still throwing bad energy and spies our way. Some of their members disbanded after the initial conflict and since disappeared from Discord altogether.

Mushroom Cult continues to bother people elsewhere with their behavior, with internet trolling &amp; anarchistic ideals. Their rule of thumb is it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s true, they are a group that revels in chaos. Blackmail &amp; doxxing is their game. Slander is common, so are group raids, server take-overs, and smearing campaigns. We did not document all of our encounters. Some of the exchanges dealt with stopping the waves of disinformation and smearing campaigns originating from their group.

Today, they mainly operate out of another server they took over. Some of their attacks continued from independent sources, their cult having no solid struct.</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a

hard to the point of exhaustion, since we resisted their hostile take-over. Some say that aspects of this war only really started due to a few of their most toxic members that love to perform harmful magicks in their pass-time. Generally speaking when people question them and ask them for more proofs, they are unable to provide anything adequate to support their claims.

These situations are unfortunately a fairly common occurrence on Discord, where people will start a riot and gain mindless supporters, we strongly believe that Mushroom_king is manipulating their members, threatening real-world violence and with some other crooked law officials on their side believing that they are social justice warriors on the internet. When people are not a good fit for Concord they sometimes end up in their cult, Why? Likely not because we haven&#39;t given enough changes to improve and grow, but often out of spite and trying to find others to strengthen and breathe the flow of hatred they corrupt upon occult communities. There are 2-3 groups that we&#39;ve come across with these harmful ideals, and mushroom cult being persistent in their persuasiveness and disinformation, however inconsistent and within their own defined contexts.

We&#39;ve had our fair share of psy-op campaigns against them to <em>protect</em> members within Concord from getting involved with them. We have always had the advantage, having done no wrong-doing and being respectable individuals; having better campaigns against their forces, having better protection and strength. Now in the end, we are at a cease-fire, and I say this as there have been no constructive talks for a means to an end, only shifting the blame and maybe a slap on the wrist to those that were working under their rule unfavorably. There is a chance that one of their agents may surface again, until then we will remain on standby, evolving the protections of this server. The war has never truly &quot;ended&quot;.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 29, 2025 8:18‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

OPSEC is important and plays a huge factor in the topics I frequent. For example, you&#39;ll have a hard time finding information on wards/barriers here aside from a handful of techniques. You&#39;ll have a hard time finding information on how to operate with curses, hexes, and other nasty things. That was intentional. There are also some things we keep to ourselves because knowing might not provide any benefit to you / your journey. I am opposed to speaking openly about certain topics, and discourage the use of offensive magicks. There are at times things that might seem deceitful, but intending that every word makes some sort of impact in the collective knowing/theory of everything occult/esoteric when it comes to psychic stuff, energy, souls, spirits, afterlife; Some things are left to open interpretation, and as we are still in the &quot;stone age&quot; of spirituality, some things you simply need to discover on your own accord, and some things are such that it&#39;s hazardous to continue so we put effort into putting in enough warnings if it isn&#39;t obvious.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A family seal is a sigil for your family or bloodline. One can be established through ritualistic intention. Members of your family can be expanded through placed intentions. Your family seal does not necessarily have to exist; It may include your family crest if you&#39;re looking for something quick. Those that associate as being belonging to this sigil/seal could be roped in by association. Be mindful of where you&#39;re placing your intentions, if you&#39;re summoning an entity using your family seal, know that it&#39;s typically a double edged sword and might make it easier to find and respect those associating with the sigil/seal. It might also make it easier to harm them, too.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The goal is to fill up your metaphorical bucket, until it is overflowing with energy; Take from this overflow and be careful about taking more than that. Be careful not to burn up the bucket; be careful not to directly consume the energy instead of adding it to your bucket. Be careful to filter if necessary, sometimes what&#39;s needed to filter/convert to a suitable form might be in of itself more intensive than it&#39;s worth.
If you have low reserves to start with, fear not, for this can be exercised, but like other things in energy work, not pushing too hard nor too little. Your reserves will gradually increase over time.

First of all I will say, if you are <u><strong>Just</strong></u> starting out, then even our most foundational of tasks will seem out of reach. Cleansing, grounding, energy/spirit work, shadow work, barriers, sight etc., these are nice skills to have and keep going with when you&#39;ve already started. If you know <em>literally nothing</em> about these subjects, then start somewhere more mundane. Pick up herbology. Learn how to read/write runes. Learn what you can about the myths and the important lessons in history. There is more to astral projection than simply adventuring recklessly. There is more to spirituality than speaking with spirits.

I have seen some people jump into the advanced and dangerous areas of practice without knowing how to do any of the foundations. If you don&#39;t <em>read all the words,</em> looking for fragments but not the whole to pick up because you simply <em>really want to do it,</em> well, it&#39;ll most likely bite you in the ass. I&#39;d like to think that I have a good sense of gauging the levels people are at, so in the event that I say <strong><u>&quot;You&#39;re not ready,&quot;</u></strong> then you likely aren&#39;t. There&#39;s probably something critical/foundational that has to be learned first, or a lesson has to be learned.

If you go on skipping critical steps then I can&#39;t help you and this isn&#39;t worth my time or yours. Some want to impose that they&#39;re some kinda big fish , but can&#39;t perform like it, default to confirmation bias, then that sounds pretty cocky and LARP to me. Maybe you aren&#39;t on Earth to be a spiritual warrior.

It&#39;s within hope that I see people move on and carry on with confidence, pride and knowledge. It&#39;s part of the itinerary to shield people from becoming a delusional mess but some people do it to themselves when they fail to listen and heed warnings. I have seen very talented/capable practitioners that have lost their minds and yes, gender plays a role in it. There are lots of variables, nobody knows them all.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, May 24, 2025 12:47‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1375878612460245042 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1375878612460245042><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 24, 2025 12:50‚ÄØPM">12:50‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/quote_1375878483229802628-1C81C.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/quote_1375878483229802628-1C81C.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: quote_1375878483229802628.png (489.34 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

So, you want to astral project, <u><strong>but do you really?</strong></u>
You&#39;ve heard all of these fantastic things about the astral plane, the entities, the philosophical questions that can be answered; pleasures, fantasy, exploration and adventure. You may see it as a casual escape from reality. You may be able to use it to have shared experiences with friends, or discover more of the mysteries of the soul.
<h2><em>HOWEVER!!</em></h2><strong>Don&#39;t</strong> ignore your journey on Earth. Don&#39;t let Astral Projection be the sole objective. When you open that door, it&#39;s hard to close. Consider that the Veil is a protection <u>for <strong>YOU</strong></u> as well as for <em>them</em>. 
If thinking about someone or merely observing them forms a connection, and you aren&#39;t equipped to handle how to sever the connection or ground/cleanse, that connection lingers. It is a two way street unless you know how to block it off.
There are some things that are beyond our help and beyond our control, because internal work is just as important as external work, and everyone <em>must</em> learn &quot;how to fish&quot; than be given free fish. 
Teaching is not easy across the internet. It can be done, but it&#39;s not recommended. We can show you the right way, but you have to be onboard with it, learning and adapting, because while we may give you a rod, <em>we cannot tell YOU</em> how to move your hands. We can point you in the right direction, but you must carefully observe and learn for your own, as well as re-challenge your existing ideas. You are a unique individual, for much energy work there are no words, and while we try to put it into a science, for what words we lack, you must have to fill in the blanks for;

You notice them? They notice you. Is it possible to be scared to death? Absolutely. Can this be <strong>distracting to your physical life journey?</strong> For sure. When you see something you&#39;re not supposed to, and it gets more intense/vivid without much effort or thought into it, and you are suddenly having an involuntary out of body experience at the worst times? Especially your <strong>first time?</strong> Yeah, not so great then, would it? Do you think yourself invulnerable or invincible? Less likely than you think, as the vessel is your <strong>greatest safety</strong> against the unknown;

Don&#39;t think for a second that having an out of body experience will always be a pleasant/safe one. Physicality spares you the troubles of your undisciplined mind. Don&#39;t assume that every entity you talk to is going to be friendly or entirely truthful with you, be wary, vetting should <strong>never</strong> be as simple as having a brief encounter and looking at things on the surface. Keep in mind that on top of grounding/cleansing and <strong>regular energy system maintenance from that point forward,</strong> you will likely encounter entities that will prey on your ignorance, steal your energy, trap your spirit, &amp; interrupt your journey in various ways, <em>Death</em> might seem like a mercy to the level of psychological and spiritual/soul damage you can encumber.

Ask yourself these questions: How far have you traveled into the depths of your own consciousness space? How well do you know your own mental state and energy system? 

<em>Please don&#39;t</em> assume that everything you hear is accurate. Telepathy is not a perfect method of communication. Your mind has the natural tendency to take and interpret things in a way that makes sense to you; it may represent the intentions, but ultimately is being spoken <em>through your mental translator</em> and one can miss important pieces of information that don&#39;t translate well to modern English.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><strong>Ki</strong> moves most when your body is moving, but it&#39;s like a thin gas of energy.
<strong>Psi</strong> is when you condense that energy from a gas into a liquid.
So psionics methods for controlling it work just fine to control Ki, you just have to keep in mind that it&#39;s moving better when you&#39;re moving, so meditation during exercise works better for Ki than sitting your ass down and condensing it until you&#39;ve got it in a liquid form
</div></div>
t&#39;s been noted that we currently reside in the &quot;Stone Age&quot; of occult, our understanding is limited, varies, and what naturally comes to us differs from what naturally comes to others. Many variables are at play when working with energy in any form. We&#39;ll assume some things, taking some things for granted; What is <em>energy,</em> what is <em>Life?</em> Great philosophers shape meaning based on our observations, great scientists test and come up with new theories. We <strong>must evolve</strong> our understanding of energy over time.

Experimentation is important. Due to the many mechanisms at play, one can assume that even with a firm basis/foundation, there are still stones left to be unturned, and still lessons that can be learned, even for seasoned veterans.

To cultivate Psi is not the same as cultivating Ki. To begin we must understand how to some degree control and manipulate these energies, transforming it into boon. There are other forms of energy that exist, and certain paths grant us unified theories, but also as to better our own understanding for what our personal truths we believe, I believe that the concept of us having &quot;layers&quot; as to exist is to exist on multiple dimensions and in multiple wavelengths at once, such is the nature of being anything in this world; there are microscopic and macroscopic levels in which we can operate within, each with varying difficulty or elements of control, starting with the mental capacity.

We can think of your energy system as your own island, that you can be part of or carry it with you to new places. Just like you are visible by reflecting light off your skin, your <em>field of influence</em> is a malleable field, it operates on a subconscious or autonomous level; The field of influence is a double edged sword. It acts as the outer edges of your aura, it can make empathic connections, it can leak some of your surface energy and presence into the surrounding environment. This field might be strong enough to transform the surrounding environment, but your consciousness has a role in where you can position yourself within this field, and you are moving your personal island with you with your actions; If you have a good enough understanding on how your field of influence permeates the surrounding space, you may be able to move through it parts of energy that seamlessly arc out from your center, and overwhelm the existing forces present in your environment to give you an advantage; cultivating energy can help achieve this, to rearrange yourself or the environment with your field of influence, a field that gets stronger towards <em>you</em> as the epicenter.

We must begin at a focal point and a fair amount of mental discipline. Assuming that many of you already have practiced moving energy balls point to point, you can also inversely explore your own field of influence and energy wells, and with knowing that your &quot;metaphorical bucket&quot; which naturally increases over time though may be damaged, can overflow with an abundance of energy once you&#39;ve reached its full capacity. Like fog on a glass window, this energy will continue to accumulate given that you are careful not to spend energy in excess of what you can produce, and failing to do so might be the end of being able to use magick whatsoever - and those that have been around long enough or are of a certain soul stuff might have a permanent energy source when careful not to burn away the bucket that holds this energy...</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/image-31399.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/image-31399.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (508.63 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

Many practitioners start with harnessing moonlight in their auras, and that is a perfectly fine way of cultivating energy while storing it up, though it may take a bit of practice to start weaving into and tapping into it. Energy can be seen as a long string, but beware that the yarn can dirty, or clash with your existing colors. Why <em>siphoning</em> can taste bad - it could very well be that their energy doesn&#39;t match your density or color. A filtering or some other form of quality control might be needed to integrate energy into your energy system, sometimes the density of the energy can be a problem, or the wrong element could be a headache, and getting such small amounts of viable energy from the people around you might make them sleepy, but it will probably make you sleepy too, like trying to suck water from the base of an ice cube.

It&#39;s important to learn what energy is most compatible with yours, and that can be a bit of a long journey in of itself. Let&#39;s go back to basics. The elements we draw from (in our system) is Earth, Air, Fire, Water, &amp; Spirit. There are subcategories branching from these main five elements, and I believe this system aligns more with modern wiccan elements (iirc). If you are some kind of divine entity, there is a good chance that you may even be able to project the ethereal element in the palm of your hand (thinking back to transforming the energy within you into a usable form with your palm gate acting as a valve), but just Psi-stuff is absolutely fine, you must use what you have and not focus on what others have, though it is said that one must practice in balance between what elements they are used to and other elements.

For the purposes of this text, we&#39;ll focus on the cultivation of energy based on environmental factors: Day/night can make a difference, being in the physical proximity of an element can make a difference (especially if it is something you&#39;re attracted to), where are you trying to store the energy?, are you meditating, dancing, and what day is it? What time of the year? Is it your name day / birthday? Because yes, all of these factors contribute to how well you can wield your own energy, and cultivate it.

The inner fire burns, but we can build a construct that surrounds the fire; like rods coming out of you, energy can be woven and collected, and from there it is up to you to filter and transfer the energy to your aura once you wrap it around yourself, and precisely channel this energy out into you from this barrier you&#39;ve created internally; Do not let that energy fall into the fire, it will burn up and not be overly useful, because it&#39;s more difficult to draw from the inner fire, and it may burn away quickly, though it is possible; Imagine as though the inner fire were also an inverse bucket, and out from the inner well comes this plume of energy, but this energy also anchors and powers your being here in this life, and at this layer it is closer to life force energy than anything that can be useful for our purposes of cultivating energy to transform and discharge it elsewhere.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Using your inner fire as a black hole then doing as described above is a different form of collecting energy, though the origins of this technique are unknown, what remains is the passed down teachings that have now been passed along to you.

I know energy is being used fairly ambiguously here. I&#39;m not going to attempt to be meticulous with something so poorly understood by today&#39;s standards. In essence, there are different layers, and different accomplishments can be done by yielding the forces of different layers. Exploration and experimentation is always at the forefront of this work, it is encouraged that you FAFO to a degree. <strong>You can&#39;t learn everything through text alone. You must also learn by <em>doing.</em></strong>

So while we have our life obligations to attend, also learning from those challenges along the way; It is with my hope that you&#39;ll have a bit of freedom in the future to go out and connect with the element that comes naturally to you, and even communicate with spirits that are familiar with that element, like fire sprites to fire and sylph to air; if only meaning and understanding was easily conveyed over the internet - then maybe I&#39;d simply intuit a telepathic record, because describing the sensations and mechanisms is its own feat, and I find myself ill prepared for explaining things that are beyond explanation; just as it is to describe how to drink tea or paint with a brush.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, August 2, 2025 5:32‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Typically speaking, having more than one polarity can account for some of the weirdness in the energy system; making siphoning the <em>right stuff</em> all the more difficult. In some cases, it could make siphoning easier. Wielders of more than one polarity may find certain actions better to execute within a &quot;sweet spot&quot; of balance with emotional regularity, use of energies from different parts of the energy system, and different mental states.

The reason why having mental discipline is important is not only because of energy work; If there&#39;s a screw loose and it hasn&#39;t been tightened, you can expect to lose your mind from basic energy work to nefarious or careless entities. This applies for most people -- especially those that have awakened or unsealed too much at once. There is an art to much of what we do: Not only in individual style of working with energy, but with pushing (energy) <em>just enough</em> while not pushing too little;

Which honestly doesn&#39;t help if you want to be open about your spirituality and wanting it to bare fruit. (Since many already have had a negative experience from those that were troubled before you, and there are many malevolent practitioners that use magick to cause chaos and do not have internal balance.)

Thoughts bloom psychic fields. Presences linger. Auras extrude in all directions. Projections can get caught on things.

The stuff of life - <em>Consciousness</em> - is a tapestry woven of various energies and forces. &quot;Energy&quot; is interpreted differently, and found to be different in form and function, across many texts. We must assume that it can have a &quot;sticky&quot; quality to it, as it has been seen to linger in objects, people, places, things; even well after the origin has left. One may repeat a mantra to themselves:

<em>May all the energy away from me come back to me, that which does not belong where it is now. So mote it be.</em>

Taking upon from teachings others have given to me, the way in which mantras and prayers resonate is a key to certain properties we can invoke; in which  certain keys/notes <em>vibrate</em> differently, and with being in mind that <em>you are a natural tuning fork,</em> you can &quot;play specific notes&quot; to invoke certain feelings, and certain forms of energy. Like glass shattering at a high note, so too can things break or be woven together with your own presence, and your emotional responses to things; It is possible to <em>&quot;hum&quot;</em> with power, and can be heard by those with the ear for it.

But recalling your own energy every now and then, even as a sanity check, especially if you feel that <em>something is missing</em> within you; is not a bad idea, and encouraged, because you do not want pieces of your energy left behind, as a link to you, as a resonance, that may harm you or others or the psychic environments you are in.

Though, the veil can be seen through more clearly by being in certain areas in the world, and certain individuals can see through it more clearly naturally, part of their genetic make-up. What&#39;s more, is that entities are <em>aware</em> of your sight. We could also make some assumptions based on this, that either the veil is also a shield for awareness, or awareness flows through the veil. It has been described a few times as a shimmer; and why it is called a veil, is because it&#39;s something like a cloth that is barely noticeable, but stops certain wavelengths from coming into view.
From my observations, the veil has 2 parts, which seems to wrap into one big thing. To &quot;separate yourself from the veil&quot; and &quot;leave the rest to you.&quot; There is a lot to observe, to peer through everything all at once would be overwhelming, like trying to hear all radio frequencies simultaneously, it may just come out as noise. There is a lot to see, and to simply dissolve the <em>mental construct</em> leaves you susceptible to losing grounding, and as <em>awareness</em> is also another element to the veil then we must also assume that <em>seeing</em> in of itself could also be harmful indirectly like attracting unwanted attention from something.
As there are many layers, I can describe from my observations, there are many elements to it like the aura; there is also something I can only describe as a temporal wake that ripples prismatic waves from the movements of things in &quot;the waters&quot;;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Anchoring yourself to an entity that you&#39;ve vetted and trust is a great form of practice, and practice during times of the year that work to your advantage, such as the new moon, full moon, solstice, Cinqo de Mayo (May 5), Samhain (Oct 31 - Nov 1), and whenever else is most convenient for you to sit for some deal of time to practice intently. It has been said that clearing the mind of any mental distractions such as spontaneous thoughts and elevator music is recommended. It&#39;s uncertain whether or not being grounded to the Earth helps, but I feel it is important to do so before hand and afterwards. &quot;Mixed&quot; individuals will likely have the easiest time &quot;separating themselves from the veil&quot; and attempting to peer through it. Starting with auras and hemispherical brain sync is worth trying, as is staring into the fires and the stars, and widening the pupils to the faint light, to see more than the simple bands of light, but the essence of pure energy behind it;
Everyone&#39;s sight works differently, it has been observed that on some genetic level, certain individuals have an easier time with practicing trying to see through the veil than others. Several different ways have been mentioned by many practitioners, some opt to blindfold or stand in pure darkness until the eyes pick up nothing but the faintest light, some hone their field of influence to attempt to be aware of their surroundings entirely; Some suggest attempting to use one&#39;s own mind to <em>&quot;turn off&quot;</em> all physical sensory input, to concentrate on the breath and the heart, until only that which remains are the spiritual senses. Some suggest to meditate solely on the phantom limbs, whether it is as a simple projection of the spiritual hand or something related to the kin of your soul. However long it takes, and one&#39;s predisposition to its ease of access, varies <em>greatly</em> practitioner to practitioner, and at which point could possibly lead to <em>madness,</em> as to not only <em>seek</em> such a gift that you may not intuitively or naturally possess is as difficult as to be open and flooded with information, to the point where one can lose themselves in the sea of consciousness, to the point of corruption at the level of the soul, to being greatly susceptible and sensitive to that which is on the Otherside, which can ultimately be uncomfortable. It is said that <em>seeing</em> is a blessing or a curse, those that seek that knowledge and wish to continue down that path must heed this.
<em>&quot;You must be crazy for wanting all of that,&quot;</em> a <em>common</em> sentence spoken by many that <em>see,</em> learning to shut the door is another exercise entirely, for once the door is opened, closing it is difficult, like swimming against a current, it may have to be fought for.</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/528550113_1061725686085872_921176564055228-F0F94.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/528550113_1061725686085872_921176564055228-F0F94.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: 528550113_1061725686085872_9211765640552282326_n.png (1.26 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

I have two formats for creating talismans. It&#39;s important to note that a talisman can be created using any surface, including but not limited to pen &amp; paper, or carvings on wood or rock. Though, talismans need not be marked necessarily with anything recognizable. A simple rock that has been carved into could also be a talisman. How effective the talisman is depends on a few factors, including how long the talisman has been &quot;soaking&quot; the intentions one puts into it, to whether or not it can be burned to be &quot;activated&quot; in a specific manner. This is a fairly general and loose guide onto making a talisman.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">A talisman is any object ascribed with religious or magical powers intended to protect, heal, or harm individuals for whom they are made.

The phase of the moon is also a factor, for example, one may use talismans in conjunction with the Full Moon for culmination and fruition, divination, protection, and manifestation; while the New Moon is better suited for cutting ties, new beginnings, potential, shadow work, other kinds of manifestation, and introspection.

We are going on the principle of time/place and intention; If we are intending that we are doing something in the physical plane, creating a paper talisman is something that can be easily constructed or destroyed if necessary, and serves as an anchor to this world. Blood is sometimes used for specific talismans that draws upon your own life force or has some kind of energetic foothold that ties to you, but that is beyond the scope of this text, simply know that these kinds of talismans are often double-edged swords, as it connects to your life force directly.

The day of the week may also play a role in efficiency, notably in Ancient Egyptian &amp; Greek mythos, where specific deities are invoked for specific purposes, such as Sunday representing Ra or Atum (representing the sun as it sets), or Apollo (in late mornings). There is mixed information with this and it&#39;s recommended that you do a little research on your own about the days and entities you&#39;re working with.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">A sigil is a symbol, often pictorial, that represents a specific intention or desire, commonly used in magic rituals and chaos magick.

<strong>Fair warning:</strong> Mixing different styles is possible, but might not be as effective. It may take some trial and error. The more effort you put in for correctness (circles done with a compass, straight lines, calligraphy, etc), typically makes for better effect. As we write in dimensions of intentions, the elements must be well understood by the invoking forces. Mixing languages and symbology is not recommended, I&#39;d say it&#39;s moreover advanced. Expect more things to go wrong when you crossover symbology and languages.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When doing energy work, we must invoke a state of consciousness from which we can build off of, adding intentions energies, <em>and</em> emotions cumulatively and adjusting things as we go. Weaving new techniques and methods is perfectly sane and possible if you have a good understanding of what you&#39;re doing.

Shields/barriers/wards for example, is something that incorporates a blend of intuitive or predisposed knowledge, making use of multiple concepts tuned to keeping <em>yourself</em> or someone/something else &quot;safe&quot;; Woven into the fabric of all constructs is a basis for how other forms of energy interact with the fabric of your construct. If your affinity is fire, you may have a harder time defending against the opposite element; but incorporation of another element or energy strategy could mitigate the effectiveness of its natural weakness.

This is the core concept of weaving techniques and methods. Achieving a specific result through making use of multiple strategies, energies or constructs; If you could imagine, an &quot;unlock system&quot; for yourself, it takes a certain level of knowledge in order to achieve something more advanced, like astral projection, as many are aware, I have a great deal of prerequisites one must read through or be prepared for in order to reach that stage, and makes use of all the &quot;technologies&quot; we&#39;ve gathered so far for working with our system. There is also the principle of getting to know how <em>your system</em> operates, as it is unique to <em>you,</em> and what <em>you</em> can do will rarely line up with what <em>others</em> can do when it comes to techniques. One does not simply see through the veil over conceptualization alone, it <em>requires</em> trial and error, as it does in which you form your fingerprint/identity on <em>your</em> style, and so long as you are prepared for the dangers you may encounter - knowing what to use, when to use it and how - and what self limitations should be included, be it the cost of your energy or your moral compass; This is another reason why that walking down this path is not something that takes months or years, but a lifetime of experimentation, exploration and seeking results.

While the universe/balance or synchronicity is often forgiving of mistakes you&#39;ll make from the people you affect, the act of doing and knowing as you do the harm that you cause is not as easily forgiven. Sometimes paying the heavy price is needed for growth, and there are times when your peers will blunder, and sometimes it takes their sanity. So with that in mind, doing <em>everything that you should</em> is also walking a fine line between sanity and insanity, as illusions and daydreams are often more vivid than reality, inadvertently you may fall down a path where either you live to tell tales that others find hard to believe, or live a life of delusion and should be avoided, for nothing of value comes from that which must <em>force</em> others to believe in a certain mindset, driven by delusional madness...</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/517459488_1041416551450119_411528162967821-2A9EF.png> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/517459488_1041416551450119_411528162967821-2A9EF.png alt="Image attachment" title="Image: 517459488_1041416551450119_4115281629678215517_n.png (1.27 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

But <strong>if it works, it works.</strong> Once you&#39;ve figured out your own <em>formula,</em> perhaps you&#39;d want to encode that pattern knowledge into your incantice, as I do often when performing new forms of energy work successfully, to reinforce by &quot;writing it down&quot; in a way that allows for the intuitive natural channeling of that pattern through my energy system; Perhaps you may want to write a symbol that invokes the feelings. While there are theoretical limits that which we must respect - the possibilities are &quot;endless,&quot; as long as your intentions guide the energy to performing appropriate actions.

The topic was brought up recently and felt a need to cover this topic despite fundamentally being an information hazard for a few reasons. It should be noted that in the travels I&#39;ve personally been on the Astral Plane that there are many authoritative entities that possess these &quot;Soul Weapons&quot;; In fact, I&#39;d say that they are quite common, and some are simply tools that can have destructive purpose like a simple kitchen knife. There are many different kinds with what effects can vary from simple but powerful vibrational based attacks, to projectile and directed energy weapons to things that are more complex that channel the field of influence and a compressed Ki wave to deliver &quot;wide-range&quot; attacks that if executed correctly can cut through astral materials on a large scale. In another sense, anything that you can think of can be materialized, if you can think it, and with enough energy. Soul weapons <em>can</em> be astrally forged, and they <em>can</em> exist embedded within &quot;ordinary&quot; physical objects, including a &quot;regular ol&#39; stick&quot;, <img

They can have their own energetic signature like a presence. They can have different states, like shapeshifting swords and growing bamboo staffs.

<u>Some important things to note here:</u><ul><li>Not everyone can wield the same weapon, whether due to elemental or energetic type incompatibility, insufficient energy, or safeguards on the weapon itself.</li><li>There are some weapons that only materialize once, these weapons are often not stored in the core but within a pocket dimension or are constantly worn.</li><li>It&#39;s not the size of the weapon, it&#39;s how you use it. (Think about it like this: A master swordsman can cut through the strongest steel with any weapon, at the same time cannot cut through paper - or something along those lines.)</li><li>Sometimes they are rematerialized completely through blueprints, the most common way of storing <em>SW</em> through the shells of the Soul Core.</li></ul>
Creating them and storing them is another complexity altogether, with lack of proper wording without adding in a little creative verbal seasoning. Wise words said lately include being gifted a weapon, and following your intuition. As we are dealing with more things that are intuit lately; Awareness is the key to many things. One must learn how to dematerialize constructs (if possible for it), then gaining the information and energy required to rematerialize it. One may recycle most of the energy from a single weapon for future use if it&#39;s large yet small enough to fit within one&#39;s capacities, although rematerializing <em>many</em> of the same would either not have the same effect or be too <em>costly</em> to reproduce on your own.

Start small. One may simply create a Ki-ball of a particular <em>flavour</em>, then deconstruct it to its base level back into the aura. Getting more familiar with the process, you might want to start messing around with shells and hopefully not break anything like omit a particular frequency that you need. When you get the hang of the process and not simply just creating a &quot;whole other Ki-ball&quot; but instead drawing upon a blueprint that can &quot;instantly&quot; materialize with the energy you put into it; you may proceed to creating more complex things or embark on a quest to collect exotic flavours of energy that work well with your energy system. You&#39;re even encouraged to go off in peaceful search of these energies or even whole weapons from others in the astral plane. Even the energies/emanations themselves can be harmful though, so always treat new things like a biohazard and isolate them like you would in a proper laboratory setting until you&#39;re confident that you can integrate it properly.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=100><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=üíØ src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82shadowsword%20%5B680529103375433757%5D.html_Files/1f4af-4CFF5.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

If you compound something that takes 10x or 100x more output than you would usually put out, what do you think is going to happen? Quantitative speaking, you will encounter limits when trying to summon forth higher outputs of energy; Compounding energetic <em>oomph</em> can only be exherted all at once <em>from your ES</em> if you&#39;re already naturally capable of handling a higher output. If you aren&#39;t, whether that be a lack of proper maintaining the shell to be adequate to your spiritual pressure or, you&#39;re running into some other fundamental scalar limitation for <em>your</em> energy system needs. Therefore, unless you&#39;re absolutely sure you can both maintain that level of compound output and channel this effectively, why not dump energy into another medium? Then, the only limitation is speed. But, 10x output is still 10x output, so you&#39;re either draining your resources in serial so that you don&#39;t overdo it, or you&#39;re pushing past the limits of your own meridians, and unless you&#39;re pretty good at reconnecting and fixing them, you&#39;re likely off not doing it in parallel.
For the most part aside from some quirky physics, <em>&quot;We follow the laws of thermodynamics&quot;</em>. Think of it like the output for a direct energy weapon and the limitation is overheating. You may be able to output a high intensity beam for a few seconds, but that 1x beam for 0.2s costs you all of your overheating allotment, so you&#39;re either going to have to squeeze more output in less time with the risk of overheating or having to mitigate some of the issue in some other form or rather; Sometimes this is at the cost for &quot;surface space&quot; so that it may be easier for your foe to cause damages to you.
Thus it becomes also a matter of how much allotment you choose is acceptable for output, because there are significant risks with overloading the energy system or depletion; If working with the energies freely available around you, it would become a matter of trying to channel that energy through your field of influence, which may cost more than what you can give to have influence on it; Though it is possible to use this or modulation of a net of energy to cause effect that would otherwise cost less if you were trying to directly summon it from your energy system, depending on the kinds of things you&#39;re &quot;grabbing&quot; or otherwise using.
Everything has a cost, whether that is speed, or how much output you can throw from your reserves; You may be able to summon forth a good volume of energy, but your overall reserves might quicken to depletion; You might be able to store enough energy into a blast using pulse bursts and quick mitigation/damage control, but at the cost of time. Lastly something that hits heavy doesn&#39;t necessarily have to have a lot of oomph, frequencies dominate at higher levels;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
