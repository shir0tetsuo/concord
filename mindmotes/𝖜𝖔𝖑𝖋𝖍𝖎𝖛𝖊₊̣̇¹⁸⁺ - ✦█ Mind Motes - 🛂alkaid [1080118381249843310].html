Verifying an entity‚Äôs identity is done through vetting. When we use deities as an example of a spirit we might be vetting, we usually do this by asking them questions about their mythos, which they should be able to answer accurately each and every time. Usually, we do this through the use of a pendulum, but we can also use any other method, like energy reading, tarot reading, and so on. If they fail to respond correctly, you&#39;re probably communicating with a false spirit that is posing as the deity or spirit you are trying to contact. (These false spirits can be trickster spirits, false light spirits, parasites (some kinds of mimic parasites), impostor spirits, lying spirits, vultures (mid to higher vultures), godforms, egregores, etc.) If this occurs, drive the spirit out right away through banishment, and remember to protect yourself.

A spirit must be continually vetted. It&#39;s not a good idea to decide to trust spirit&#160;completely after asking them three questions. You must consider red flags that may arise even after you have begun working with them. This isn&#39;t meant to induce paranoia; rather, it&#39;s meant to familiarize you to being attentive and prudent just as you would when you&#39;re around a stranger.

Visualization is more about seeing what you envision in your mind rather than what you are physically observing. This practice can lead to inaccuracies in one&#39;s observations, and it is a common approach that often results in a significant number of practitioners facing challenges due to the inherent meaning of the word itself.

The true essence of visualization lies in synthesizing information from all aspects and piecing it together to form a complete image or a comprehensive understanding of one&#39;s surroundings. This is particularly relevant when it comes to direct interactions with spirit guides, ancestors, deities, past lives, and the like. It requires a clear mind, prepared and open to fully receive, rather than having active thoughts that might fill in the gaps independently, obstructing genuine interaction.

This crucial aspect is often overlooked, leading individuals to &quot;imagine&quot; what they see and inadvertently bias their perceptions. Even after proper divination, scanning/reading, and with highly experienced practitioners, there is a risk of assuming an experience is entirely authentic when, in some cases, it might be the mind playing a role in imagining what occurred rather than the reality of the interaction between the practitioner and the spirit. <strong>Experience takes precedence over visualization</strong>.

Essentially, the envisioned interaction with deities and spirits should be within the full scope of the present moment, not dwelling in the past or anticipating the future. It is not about imagination but about perceiving the exact moment as it is and interpreting it in that state.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A mental puppet essentially results from internal conversations being personified into external or even internal entities, they can even occur during channeling from a channeler or even diviner interpreting communication with spirits. These entities, such as the higher self, souls, spirits, deities, demons, angels, guardian angels, or guides, may not be independent entities but rather projections of our thoughts. Recognizing a mental puppet involves considering certain characteristics:
<ul><li><em>Compliance to Whims</em>: A mental puppet tends to act in alignment with your expectations and desires, lacking independent agency.</li><li><em>Absence of New Information</em>: Interactions with a mental puppet seldom yield new or unique insights beyond what you already know, reflecting its origins in your thoughts.</li><li><em>Limited Knowledge</em>: The mental puppet&#39;s knowledge is confined to your own, indicating that it may not possess information beyond what you consciously hold.</li><li><em>Lack of Autonomy</em>: Unlike autonomous entities, mental puppets operate solely based on your will and lack the capacity for independent action.</li><li><em>Signs on Demand</em>: A mental puppet typically offers no omens or signs unless actively sought, contrasting with genuine external entities that may guide without direct prompting.</li></ul>
Understanding mental puppets is crucial for discernment. Since you initially endowed them with a narrative, dispelling them involves reclaiming control over the story you assigned, thereby dismantling the illusion.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Initiating mental work is a foundational step that practitioners should prioritize to mitigate the influence of overactive thoughts and address unhealed aspects of the mind and emotions. This process involves refining the mind through self-evaluation, shadow work, and introspection to achieve a state of stability. Confronting inner demons and unresolved issues, including trauma, fears, and escapism, is essential. It is common for individuals in spiritual practices to seek solace in occult or spiritual pursuits, potentially romanticizing these experiences for comfort, creating a filter rather than genuine supernatural interaction.

Authentic engagement with the occult and spiritual dimensions demands an honest confrontation with personal challenges. Wishing problems away or ignoring them only perpetuates unresolved issues and risks overlaying mental struggles with spiritual experiences. To establish a genuine connection with the spiritual realm, practitioners must deal with their inner conflicts, even if it is a gradual process. This approach contributes to a fortified mind, enhanced emotional and spiritual well-being, and an improved overall quality of life.

Neglecting personal issues when engaging with occult or spiritual practices increases the likelihood of projecting mental challenges onto these experiences. It is imperative to deal with your struggles incrementally, fostering mental clarity and an objective mindset in the craft. Strengthening the mind not only improves interactions with the spiritual but also serves as a deterrent against challenges or negative influences attempting to sway practitioners.

Approaching occult or spiritual practices without sufficient introspection, mind-clearing, and an objective mindset can lead to misguided experiences. Regardless of paths in the occult or spiritual realms, the mind&#39;s importance cannot be overlooked.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Definition</em>:
Front-load, derived from &quot;front&quot; (to appear before) and &quot;load&quot; (to make someone carry), is a term used in metaphysical and spiritual contexts. It refers to the act of deliberately introducing specific auxiliary information that conflicts with the ability to accurately discern the truth from what is given in advance. This unintentional delivery &#39;load&#39; the recipient with information that may hinder the reception of genuine insights, especially by individuals with extrasensory perception (ESP) or heightened intuitive abilities.

<em>Usage</em>:
Front-loading commonly occurs when information is provided before engaging in energy-related work, such as energy reading/scanning, divination, or seeking spiritual insights from realms beyond the physical. This auxiliary information often introduced subtly or through suggestion, can significantly alter a person&#39;s perception, potentially clouding their ability to receive accurate and unfiltered insights.
<ul><li><em>Implications for Energy Reading/Scan</em>:</li></ul>In energy reading or scanning, front-loading can distort the practitioner&#39;s interpretation of the energetic field. Preconceived notions or biased information may lead to misreadings, hindering the practitioner&#39;s ability to provide precise and helpful insights. This can impact the practitioner&#39;s understanding of their energy dynamics and compromise the effectiveness of energy-related interventions.
<ul><li><em>Dangers in Divination</em>:</li></ul>Front-loading poses significant risks in divination practices. When information is pre-supplied, it may influence the diviner&#39;s interpretation of symbols, signs, or messages received during the divination process. This interference can lead to inaccurate predictions, hindering the practitioner&#39;s ability to make informed decisions based on the diviner&#39;s or channeler&#39;s guidance.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The term &quot;liminal&quot; is frequently employed to describe a state of being that exists at the threshold, occupying a liminal space between two distinct realms or realities. Traditionally, liminality denotes a condition that resides at, or straddles, a boundary or threshold. 

In the domain of the occult and the paranormal, &quot;liminal&quot; transcends the simplistic notions of place or emotion; it encapsulates a distinctive mode of existence. This liminal state lies between the physical/material plane and what is commonly referred to in spiritual or metaphysical discourse as &quot;the other side&quot; or the &quot;astral plane.&quot; This is not just a metaphorical space but a parallel dimension that reflects our own reality, yet shrouded in a veil of otherness, where the rules of existence are fluid and often subverted. In this intermediary zone, the veil between worlds is permeable. To be a liminal person or entity is to inhabit this interstitial space, dwelling on the margins of two worlds. Such individuals may experience reality in a manner that fully diverges sharply from the norm, perceiving phenomena that elude conventional understanding. These individuals are often perceived as conduits of the thresholds, the in-betweens, navigating fluidly - and existing - between them. 

Liminal beings or entities typically exhibit heightened sensitivity to the subtler energies and emotional undercurrents that permeate their environments. They may feel perpetually dislocated, never fully anchored in any single location or moment in time. While they operate within the physical world, they are also finely walking in the peripheries of all dimensional planes, capable of perceiving the underlying currents and energies that most perceptive practitioners and scanners remain unaware of. Their ability to sense, and at times, approach the astral plane does not <em>always</em> imply a constant dual presence -- but it can be a reference from myself who is liminal. On another note, it can also signify a latent capacity to expand their consciousness, momentarily bridging the gap between dimensions when the need arises.

It is crucial to dispel certain misconceptions about what it means to be a liminal person or entity.  Being sensitive to energies, having certain forms of existence or perception relating to astral or having certain entanglements with the astral or other sides / dimensions, etc, does not inherently categorize someone as a liminal. True liminality is far more nuanced; it involves an direct alignment with the in-between thresholds of existence, a natural attunement to the interstices that exist beyond simple astral / dimensional perception or connection. It is a singular state of being, characterized by its rarity and unknown nature, frequently subject to misunderstanding and misinterpretation.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279351582210658304 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279351582210658304><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:06‚ÄØAM">4:06‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279351888629727353 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279351888629727353><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:07‚ÄØAM">4:07‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>The Consequences of Engaging with Entities in Occult Practices</strong></em>

Engaging with entities, whether through occult practices, spiritual rituals, or paranormal exploration, has long been a part of human experience. From ancient shamans communing with spirits to modern practitioners invoking deities or otherworldly beings, the desire to connect with entities beyond the physical realm has driven countless individuals to explore the boundaries of consciousness and reality. However, this engagement is not without its risks. The act of using or invoking an entity can have profound consequences on the practitioner, often leading to negative alterations of their mental, emotional, or even physical state.

<em><strong>Understanding Entities and Their Nature</strong></em>

Entities, in the context of occult practices, are non-physical beings or forces that exist in various spiritual or metaphysical dimensions. These entities can range from benevolent spirits and guides to malevolent beings or demons. Each entity carries its own unique energy, purpose, and influence. Engaging with them involves opening oneself up to their presence and potentially their power, often through rituals, invocations, or meditative states.

While some practitioners seek to gain wisdom, protection, or power from these entities, it is crucial to understand that not all entities are neutral or benign. Just as humans have different personalities and intentions, so too do entities. Some may seek to help, while others may have their own agendas or feed off the energy of those who summon them. This inherent unpredictability is what makes engaging with entities a potentially hazardous endeavor.

One of the most immediate and profound effects of engaging with entities is on the practitioner&#39;s psychological and emotional state. Entities can influence thoughts, emotions, and perceptions, sometimes leading to a loss of mental clarity or emotional stability. A practitioner may experience heightened anxiety, depression, or feelings of paranoia. In some cases, entities can create a sense of dependency or obsession, where the individual feels compelled to continually engage with the entity, leading to a deterioration of mental health.

<strong>Energetic Drain and Attachment</strong>:
Certain entities are known to drain energy from those they interact with. This can manifest as chronic fatigue, lethargy, or a sense of being constantly depleted. Energetic vampires, for instance, thrive on the energy of others, and by engaging with them, practitioners may unwittingly become their source of sustenance. Over time, this can lead to severe physical exhaustion and a diminished capacity to function in daily life. Additionally, some entities may form attachments to practitioners, lingering in their energetic fields long after initial contact, causing ongoing disturbances and challenges.

<strong>Altered Perception and Reality Distortion</strong>:
Entities, particularly those from dimensions vastly different from our own, can alter a practitioner&#39;s perception of reality. This may lead to hallucinations, distorted thoughts, or a fractured sense of self. The lines between the physical and spiritual worlds can become blurred, making it difficult for the practitioner to distinguish between what is real and what is not. This altered state of perception can result in dangerous behaviors, poor decision-making, and even accidents as the individual&#39;s grasp on reality weakens.

<strong>Spiritual and Ethical Deterioration</strong>:
Engaging with entities, especially those of a darker nature, can erode a practitioner&#39;s spiritual and ethical foundations. In pursuit of power, knowledge, or influence, one may be tempted to make compromises that go against their moral or spiritual beliefs. This can lead to a gradual decline in personal integrity, a loss of spiritual direction, or even a descent into practices that are harmful to oneself and others. Furthermore, entities that thrive on negative emotions, such as anger, hatred, or fear, can amplify these feelings within the practitioner, leading them down a path of darkness and self-destruction.

<strong>Physical Manifestations and Harm</strong>:
In some cases, the negative influence of entities can manifest physically. This can include unexplained illnesses, injuries, or sensations of being touched or attacked by unseen forces. These physical symptoms are often a reflection of the deep energetic and psychological impact that entities can have. In extreme cases, practitioners have reported poltergeist activity, where the entities they engaged with begin to influence their physical environment, creating chaos and fear.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279352222546788448 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279352222546788448><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:08‚ÄØAM">4:08‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279352617222406205 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279352617222406205><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:10‚ÄØAM">4:10‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>The Importance of Boundaries and Protection</strong></em>

Given the potential consequences of engaging with entities, it is vital for practitioners to approach such interactions with caution and respect. Setting clear boundaries and employing protection techniques are essential steps in minimizing risk. This includes establishing firm intentions, using protective symbols or rituals, creating wards or other forms of energetic or astral defenses, thoroughly vetting, and maintaining a strong sense of self-awareness, etc. Practitioners should also be mindful of their own mental and emotional states, ensuring that they are in a stable and grounded condition before attempting to engage with any entity.

Furthermore, education and discernment are key. Understanding the nature of the entity one wishes to engage with, as well as the potential risks involved, can help practitioners make informed decisions. It is also advisable to seek guidance from experienced practitioners or mentors who can provide insight and support.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279353091178762291 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279353091178762291><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:12‚ÄØAM">4:12‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279353968111255687 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279353968111255687><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:15‚ÄØAM">4:15‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>Personal Commentary on Entity Interaction</strong></em>

From my perspective, entities exist in their natural state as independent beings, interacting with each other and their surroundings according to their own inherent nature. In this state, the world of entities is untouched by external influence, reflecting a balance and harmony that is disrupted only when a practitioner decides to engage with them. The act of interacting with an entity is not merely a passive encounter but a dynamic process that involves manifestation‚Äîa deliberate act of will by the practitioner to alter the natural course of events and create a new outcome.

When a practitioner reaches out to an entity, they are not simply observing or communicating; they are actively manifesting a change. This change ripples through both the practitioner‚Äôs world and the entity‚Äôs realm, leading to a transformation that affects both parties. By invoking or calling upon an entity, a practitioner exerts their influence over that entity‚Äôs natural state, shaping its actions, presence, and even its essence to align with their own intentions and desires. In doing so, the practitioner alters the fabric of reality, steering it toward a new path. This manipulation means the entity--a part of them, too, is transformed as a direct result of the practitioner‚Äôs will.

This perspective shifts the typical understanding of deity work and interactions with entities. Rather than viewing the practitioner as a passive recipient of the entity&#39;s wisdom or power, this viewpoint suggests that the practitioner is the driving force behind the interaction. It is the practitioner‚Äôs intent and manifestation that bring the entity into a specific form or role that fits their needs -- hence what I often mention as putting them in a form that we can interact with, and essentially boxing them in humanized ideals of ours -- but not the exact or truest representation of the entity. In this light, this comment is more about the practitioner shaping and redefining a piece of an entity‚Äôs presence to serve a specific purpose.

By embracing this view, practitioners can recognize the power and responsibility they hold in their interactions with entities. Every invocation, every ritual, is an act of creation‚Äîa manifestation that bends a part of the natural state of the entity to align with the practitioner‚Äôs vision and ideals - unless there are other practitioners that try to let go of these ideals or humanizations of entities.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:20‚ÄØAM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279355193376374856 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279355193376374856><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:20‚ÄØAM">4:20‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>---

<strong>On Spiritual Escapism</strong>

Many occultists find themselves seeking validation through their craft, especially when they feel misunderstood or unacknowledged by those around them. When personal affirmation is lacking in their everyday lives, some turn to entities or spiritual paths that seem to offer recognition and acceptance. However, this pursuit can sometimes lead them down a dangerous path of self-affirmation that doesn&#39;t address their underlying issues.

Instead of fostering personal growth or self-awareness, these individuals may find that their engagement with the occult magnifies their insecurities and weaknesses. As they look to entities or practices that reinforce their existing flaws, they risk becoming more intense versions of the very qualities that have isolated them in the first place. Rather than transforming or evolving, they become entrenched in behaviors or mindsets that further alienate them from others. This cycle of seeking external validation can ultimately deepen their sense of disconnection, both from themselves and from the people around them.

In this way, the pursuit of acknowledgment through the occult can sometimes exacerbate feelings of rejection or misunderstanding, leading to a more profound internal struggle rather than the empowerment they initially sought.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279356275712327682 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279356275712327682><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:25‚ÄØAM">4:25‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<em><strong>Further Additional Idea of Entity operation</strong></em>

A significant clue in understanding how entities operate in the occult is observing how certain beliefs about their behavior seem to change based on the practitioner&#39;s perception. Often, beliefs that seem overly dramatized or exaggerated‚Äîwhat some might call &quot;larpy&quot; (Live Action Role-Playing)‚Äîabout how entities interact can suddenly lose their effectiveness when one stops visualizing the entity in that particular way.

This phenomenon suggests that the way we perceive and conceptualize entities greatly influences our experiences with them. If an entity is visualized or understood as a person, the interactions often reflect more personable qualities. This could mean that the entity, or at least the practitioner‚Äôs experience of it, responds in ways that are more aligned with human-like behaviors and emotions. This view shapes the manifestation of the entity‚Äôs influence in a way that is familiar and comprehensible to the human mind.

A notable example of this can be seen in the practices of those who engage in Lilith worship. Many practitioners report receiving boons or blessings that are closely aligned with what they perceive as Lilith‚Äôs personal preferences or characteristics. However, these manifestations tend to occur more frequently when Lilith is visualized as a person rather than as an abstract force or concept. This suggests that the personalization of the entity‚Äîseeing them as a figure with specific likes, dislikes, and personality traits‚Äîcan create a more direct and tangible interaction.

<em>Personal comment</em>: While personalizing entities can lead to more tangible and seemingly direct interactions, this approach has its downsides. Viewing entities as mere extensions of our perceptions can lead to an overly simplified understanding of their true nature and a potentially misleading sense of control or influence. When practitioners shape entities into more personable forms, they may project their desires, fears, and biases onto these beings, potentially skewing their spiritual practices and growth. This can result in a feedback loop where the practitioner only experiences what aligns with their expectations, rather than engaging with the full complexity and mystery that these entities might represent. Furthermore, this tendency to anthropomorphize can limit the practitioner‚Äôs spiritual development, as it encourages a superficial engagement based on comfort and familiarity rather than a deeper exploration of the unknown and the challenging aspects of spiritual practice. Ultimately, relying too heavily on this personalized view can create a narrow and self-referential spiritual experience, diminishing the potential for genuine transformation and understanding.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279357448570011759 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279357448570011759><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:29‚ÄØAM">4:29‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<em><strong>On Entity Influence</strong></em>

One of the challenges when working with entities in the occult is the unpredictability and subtlety of the outcomes. A notable example of this can be seen with some TikTok practitioners, often referred to as &quot;TikTok witches,&quot; who may choose to work with demons or other powerful entities without fully understanding the potential consequences -- along with respecting entity history and the cultural background that they represent. This lack of understanding can lead to unintended negative effects, such as experiencing a streak of bad luck or causing harm to themselves or their loved ones. For instance, they might inadvertently invoke energies or spirits that bring about misfortune or create discord within their personal relationships, family and even physical health or mental condition; perhaps even intensifying an already existing issues to more extreme levels.

Monitoring the effects of such interactions requires careful observation of one‚Äôs life and the events that unfold following these spiritual practices. If negative occurrences begin to coincide with the initiation of contact with an entity, it could be a sign that the interaction is not having the desired effect or that the practitioner is not fully aware of the entity‚Äôs influence or disposition.

The difficulty lies in predicting or controlling the outcomes due to the often-subtle and complex nature of these spiritual beings. Unlike more straightforward magical practices, working with entities involves navigating their moods, intentions, and inherent nature‚Äîfactors that can significantly affect the practitioner‚Äôs life in unexpected ways. This unpredictability makes it crucial for practitioners to approach such relationships with caution, respect, and a deep understanding of the risks involved.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>On Relational State with Entity</strong>

The phenomenon of entities appearing to change behavior in response to practitioners can be understood as a reflection of the practitioner&#39;s manifestations influencing the entity‚Äôs characteristics. This dynamic highlights how the practitioner&#39;s beliefs, rituals, and intentions shape their experiences with these entities, making the interaction deeply personal and context-dependent.

However, this influence is not universal across all practitioners. Several factors can affect why some practitioners experience noticeable changes in entity behavior while others do not. For instance, the nature of the practitioner&#39;s relationship with the entity, their level of spiritual maturity, and their ability to channel intent effectively, past lives, soul condition, etc can all play significant roles. Not all practitioners may possess the same depth of connection or skill in manifesting their desires, leading to varied experiences with the same entity.

Moreover, some entities may appear favorable or responsive to specific individuals while remaining indifferent or even antagonistic to others. This discrepancy can be attributed to several reasons. Entities, much like people, may have preferences, alignments, or resonance with particular energies, beliefs, or practices. An entity might be drawn to or aligned with certain individuals due to their spiritual frequency, intent, or the nature of their work, making them more favorable or responsive to these practitioners.

Conversely, entities can also reject or remain unresponsive to certain practitioners. This rejection may arise from a lack of alignment between the entity‚Äôs nature and the practitioner‚Äôs beliefs or methods. An entity may sense a misalignment in intent or approach and thus choose not to engage or interact with certain individuals. Additionally, if a practitioner‚Äôs energy or intentions clash with the entity‚Äôs inherent qualities or purpose, the entity may not respond favorably or may actively resist the interaction.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em><strong>On Fighting or Killing Entities</strong></em>

The concept of interacting with and potentially harming entities reveals complex dynamics between manifestation, perception, and the fundamental nature of spiritual beings. Fundamental to understanding these interactions is the recognition that entities are not static entities but rather represent intricate patterns and forces within the universe. This perspective posits that one cannot truly &quot;kill&quot; an entity in a traditional sense but can instead alter the foundational aspects that constitute its presence and influence -- in particular with the piece of the entity we interact with, as we never truly interact with their whole due to the explanations above -- people tend to only deal with a portion or a small part of them in astral, archetype or spiritual form.

When engaging with entities, whether through worship, invocation, or confrontation, practitioners are essentially interacting with the underlying forces and patterns that these entities represent. To &quot;kill&quot; an entity, therefore, is not to obliterate its whole essence or entire existence in a literal sense but to disrupt and transform a piece ofthe fundamental elements that constitute its role and function in the universe-. This alteration is akin to guiding an interactable part of entity‚Äôs constituent elements onto a different path, thus severing this particular piece of the entity with it&#39;s previous relationship with the cosmos.

Such profound manipulation can have far-reaching consequences. If a practitioner succeeds in altering these foundational aspects even through a projection of the eneity to the extent that it is perceived as the entity‚Äôs &quot;death,&quot; it can <em>potentially</em> suggests a significant and negative impact on the fundamental forces the entity embodies. For example, if an entity associated with righteousness or goodness is profoundly altered in a negative manner, it might result in the practitioner experiencing a corresponding loss of faith or a death of moral alignment in their own life. This effect arises because the entities in question are not isolated but are deeply intertwined with broader spiritual and existential concepts.

The intricacies of this interaction become even more complex when considering the broader spiritual landscape, including astral reputations, astral nations, and astral mythological lore. For instance, if a practitioner antagonizes or &quot;kills&quot; an angelic entity, the repercussions may extend beyond the immediate realm of the entity itself, influencing concepts of righteousness and divine favor in ways that negatively impact the practitioner‚Äôs life <em>for good</em>. Similarly, disrupting the balance of forces associated with particular realms, such as hell, could manifest as bad luck or misfortune in the practitioner&#39;s life for lifetimes.

This variability and complexity underscore a critical insight: when practitioners view entities merely as discrete beings, they abstract away the deeper, often hidden, aspects of what these entities represent. Consequently, the true impact of their actions might not be immediately apparent. Negative alterations to spiritual concepts or forces can result in unforeseen consequences, affecting various aspects of life in ways that are not always directly linked to the initial interaction.

An illustrative example of this dynamic can be seen in practitioners who harm beneficial entities or forces in the astral realm. Such actions can lead to a corresponding deterioration of positive aspects in their own lives, manifesting as increased misfortune or a decline in overall well-being. This phenomenon reflects the interconnectedness of spiritual and material realities, where harming or altering spiritual forces inevitably influences one‚Äôs personal and communal experiences.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279363169369849866 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279363169369849866><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:52‚ÄØAM">4:52‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<strong>On Entity Engagement (Personal Experience)</strong>

Engaging with entities, particularly those of a challenging or malevolent nature, can profoundly impact one&#39;s life, as I discovered during my own encounters with void entities and demons. The realization that manipulating or antagonizing such entities could significantly influence my real-life circumstances emerged from a deeper understanding of the relationship between these entities and the concepts they represent.

Entities are not merely isolated beings but embodiments of broader, often complex, concepts and forces within the universe. For instance, void entities might symbolize concepts related to emptiness, chaos, or existential dread, while demons may represent aspects of disruption, conflict, or darkness. When practitioners engage with these entities, especially in confrontational or adversarial ways, they are not only interacting with the entities themselves but also with the fundamental concepts and energies that these entities embody.

The pivotal realization was that when I provoked or fought these entities, I was, in effect, disrupting the very concepts they represent. By making these entities &quot;mad&quot; or engaging them in battle, I was altering the dynamics of the forces they embody. This manipulation does not occur in isolation but rather ripples through the broader cosmic and existential fabric. Consequently, the disruption of these concepts can lead to tangible consequences in my personal life.

For example, if void entities represent the concept of existential emptiness or chaos, antagonizing them could exacerbate feelings of emptiness or disorder in one&#39;s life. Similarly, conflict with demons could manifest as increased personal strife or turmoil. The influence of these entities, therefore, extends beyond the immediate context of the interaction and impacts various aspects of the practitioner&#39;s life. The entities&#39; responses and the resultant shifts in the cosmic balance affect the practitioner&#39;s experiences and circumstances, often in ways that mirror the attributes of the concepts represented by the entities.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279363792370925649 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279363792370925649><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:54‚ÄØAM">4:54‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<strong>Entity Work In General</strong>

Entities in occult practices serve as powerful tools for practitioners, not merely as discrete beings but as embodiments of complex concepts and forces within the universe. Their usefulness stems from their nature as a collection of interconnected elements and energies that practitioners can engage with. By interacting with an entity, practitioners are essentially reaching out to and influencing these underlying forces and concepts that the entity represents--influencing a portions or parts of them that reside in various points in the cosmos/universe/astral that people can reach out and interact with, mind you.

This interaction can have profound implications for the practitioner‚Äôs life, as engaging with an entity can invite the associated concepts into their personal experience. For example, an entity representing life, evolution, and change brings with it the energies and influences related to these concepts. As a practitioner interacts with such an entity, they effectively draw these concepts into their own life, leading to significant and often transformative effects. This can manifest as an increased sense of vitality, personal growth, or even dramatic shifts in circumstances that align with the themes of life and change.

The nature of these interactions can yield both positive and negative outcomes. When engaging with an entity aligned with beneficial and empowering concepts, the effects can be profoundly positive, bringing growth, healing, and advancement into the practitioner‚Äôs life. Conversely, working with entities embodying challenging or destructive forces can introduce difficulties, conflicts, or misfortunes, as the associated energies and influences are incorporated into the practitioner‚Äôs experience -- even in subtle or hidden ways, and even in direct ways people might not realize -- a simple exposure to them, and them being present near you, but often people are stubborn or realize too late.

Entities, therefore, act as automatic manifestations‚Äîforces that interact with the practitioner‚Äôs reality in ways that are often difficult to predict or control. Their influence stems from the practitioner&#39;s engagement with the entity, which in turn affects the broader cosmic and existential dynamics.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Visual perception plays a crucial role, particularly in activities like astral projection, visualization, and spiritual scanning. Aphantasia, visual impairment, and various mental blocks can significantly influence how individuals engage with these practices. This part of my point explores how these conditions affect the experience of occult practices, emphasizing the challenges and adaptations required for effective spiritual and astral work.

<strong>Aphantasia and its Impact on Occult Practices</strong>

Aphantasia, the inability to form mental images, presents unique challenges for those involved in occult practices. Visualization is a fundamental aspect of many spiritual and magical practices, including ritual work, meditation, and astral travel. For individuals with aphantasia, the absence of internal imagery can hinder their ability to engage fully in these practices.

For example, visual scanning in astral projection‚Äîwhere practitioners attempt to perceive or interact with spiritual entities or realms‚Äîrelies heavily on the ability to create and manipulate mental images. A person with aphantasia might struggle with these techniques, finding it difficult to visualize or interpret the symbols and scenes that are integral to effective practice.

<strong>Mental Blocks and Cognitive Challenges in Occult Work</strong>

Mental blocks and cognitive challenges can exacerbate difficulties in occult practices for individuals with aphantasia or spiritual visual impairment. Internal obstacles, such as self-doubt, anxiety, or resistance to using alternative methods, can impede progress and effectiveness in spiritual work.

For example, a person with aphantasia may experience frustration or skepticism about their ability to perform visualization-based practices, leading to a lack of confidence and diminished engagement. Similarly, individuals with visual impairments may struggle with internal blocks related to acceptance or adaptation, impacting their ability to fully engage with spiritual or magical work.

<strong>Adaptations and Strategies for Effective Practice</strong>

To overcome these challenges, practitioners with aphantasia or spiritual sight impairments can explore alternative approaches and strategies. For those with aphantasia, focusing on other senses‚Äîsuch as auditory or kinesthetic methods‚Äîcan enhance their practice. Techniques like auditory meditation, sensory focus, or guided imagery involving sounds and sensations may provide viable alternatives to traditional visual practices.

Individuals with visual impairments might benefit from developing a strong intuitive sense and honing non-visual skills can compensate for visual limitations.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<h2>Confirmation Bias and Dunning Kruger Effect in Occult </h2>
Occult and astral practices often involve deeply personal and subjective experiences, including beliefs in past lives, otherkin identities, and interactions with spiritual entities. These practices are susceptible to cognitive biases and psychological phenomena that can influence practitioners&#39; perceptions and interpretations. This post explores how confirmation bias and the Dunning-Kruger effect impact individuals involved in these practices, affecting personal perception and spiritual experiences.

<strong>Confirmation Bias in Occult and Astral Practices</strong>

Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information that confirms one‚Äôs preexisting beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence. In occult and astral practices, this bias can manifest in several ways:

-<em>Past Life Beliefs</em>: Individuals who believe in past lives may focus on experiences that support their past life narratives, disregarding evidence that contradicts these beliefs. For example, certain dreams or encounters might be interpreted as past life recollections, reinforcing belief despite a lack of empirical evidence.
-<em>Otherkin Identities</em>: Those identifying as otherkin may experience confirmation bias in how they interpret their experiences. They might notice or remember instances that align with their otherkin identity while dismissing those that do not fit this framework.
-<em>Entity Relations</em>: Practitioners who interact with spiritual entities may experience confirmation bias in their interpretations. They might focus on signs or messages that align with their expectations, reinforcing their belief in the entity‚Äôs existence while ignoring contradictory evidence.

<strong>The Dunning-Kruger Effect and Its Influence</strong>

The Dunning-Kruger effect describes how individuals with low ability or knowledge in a domain may overestimate their competence. In occult and astral practices, this effect can manifest as follows:

-<em>Overconfidence in Abilities</em>: Practitioners with limited experience may overestimate their skills in areas such as astral projection (astral sparring power or abilities) and other forms of personal powers from incarnation/reincarnation, etc, leading to an erroneous belief in exceptional abilities despite a lack of evidence or training.
-<em>Misinterpretation of Experiences</em>: The Dunning-Kruger effect can lead to misinterpretation or overestimation of spiritual experiences, untapped potential or spiritual powers inherited from past lives. For instance, a novice might see a mundane experience as a profound revelation, reinforcing their belief in their exceptional abilities.
-<em>Resistance to Feedback</em>: Those affected may resist feedback from more experienced practitioners, as their overconfidence leads to dismissive attitudes toward constructive advice, hindering personal growth and accurate understanding.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 6:36‚ÄØAM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279381804264067153 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279381804264067153><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 6:06‚ÄØAM">6:06‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279382270427402281 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279382270427402281><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 6:08‚ÄØAM">6:08‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Impact on Personal Perception and Spiritual Practices</strong>

Both confirmation bias and the Dunning-Kruger effect significantly impact personal perception and spiritual practices:

-<em>Perception of Validity</em>: Confirmation bias can skew practitioners&#39; understanding of their own spiritual practices, spiritual/astral power/skill and abilities, reinforcing existing beliefs rather than fostering objective assessment.
-<em>Skill Development</em>: The Dunning-Kruger effect can impede skill development by fostering overconfidence, limiting growth and effectiveness in practices.
-<em>Interpersonal Dynamics</em>: Biases can affect interactions within occult communities, impacting collaboration, feedback, and the personal growth of a person. 

<strong>Addressing Biases and Enhancing Practices</strong>

To mitigate the effects of confirmation bias and the Dunning-Kruger effect, practitioners can:

-<em>Seek Diverse Perspectives</em>: Engage with a variety of viewpoints to counteract confirmation bias and gain a balanced understanding of spiritual practices.
-<em>Pursue Continued Learning</em>: Ongoing education and self-reflection can help address overconfidence and improve assessment of one‚Äôs skills and knowledge.

<h2>Anchoring Bias in the Occult</h2>
Anchoring bias occurs when individuals rely too heavily on an initial piece of information (the &quot;anchor&quot;) when making decisions or judgments. This bias can significantly influence how practitioners perceive and interpret their spiritual and occult experiences, particularly concerning past lives, otherkin identity, and spiritual/astral abilities.

<strong>Anchoring Bias in Past Lives</strong>

<em>Initial Impressions</em>: Beliefs or experiences encountered early in one‚Äôs exploration of past lives can serve as anchors, shaping how subsequent past life experiences are interpreted. For example, if a practitioner initially believes they were a prominent figure in a past life, this belief can influence how they interpret future past life recollections, reinforcing the initial impression.
<em>Confirmation of Past Life Narratives</em>: Practitioners may anchor their understanding of past lives based on early memories or experiences, selectively focusing on details that align with their initial impressions while disregarding contradictory information. This can lead to a skewed perception of their past life experiences.

<strong>Anchoring Bias in Otherkin Identity</strong>

<em>Identity Formation</em>: For those identifying as otherkin, initial experiences or insights can act as anchors, shaping how they perceive and interpret their non-human essence or identity. Early experiences that strongly affirm their otherkin identity may lead them to view all subsequent experiences through this lens, potentially limiting their perspective.
<em>Reinforcement of Beliefs</em>: Anchoring bias can cause individuals to focus on experiences that align with their otherkin identity while ignoring those that do not. This reinforcement of the initial identity can lead to a more rigid and less flexible understanding of their otherkin self.

<strong>Anchoring Bias in Spiritual/Astral Powers and Potentials</strong>

<em>Early Experiences</em>: Initial experiences or perceived abilities in spiritual or astral practices can serve as anchors, influencing how practitioners evaluate their current capabilities. If an individual‚Äôs first significant experience in astral projection, astral sparring or when scanned by others in their aura, energy, potential, etc was particularly vivid or powerful, they might anchor their expectations and assessments of their abilities based on this early experience.
<em>Perception of Growth</em>: Practitioners may anchor their understanding of their spiritual or astral growth to early achievements or experiences, potentially underestimating or overestimating their current abilities or developments. This can lead to an overemphasis on past experiences and a lack of recognition of present growth and actual potential.

<strong>Impact on Personal Perception and Practices</strong>

<em>Skewed Self-Assessment</em>: Anchoring bias can affect how practitioners assess their current abilities and experiences. For instance, someone who had a particularly intense early experience might anchor their self-assessment to this event, impacting their perception of growth or changes in their spiritual practice.
<em>Missed Decline or Stagnation</em>: Practitioners might not recognize if their skills have declined or become rusty due to anchoring bias. By focusing too heavily on past successes, they may overlook a gradual decline in abilities or lack of development, leading to an inaccurate assessment of their current capabilities.

<strong>Addressing Anchoring Bias</strong>

<em>Reflect on Growth</em>: Regularly reflect on and reassess personal growth and abilities, considering both early experiences and recent developments. This can help in recognizing progress as well as any decline or stagnation.
<em>Stay Open-Minded</em>: Approach spiritual and occult practices with an open mind, allowing for the possibility of new insights and experiences that might differ from initial anchors.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 6:19‚ÄØAM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<h2>Disparity of abilities between 1st-5th years practitioners and 10th-15th+ years practitioners</h2>
<h2>1. <strong>Natural Talent and Sensitivity</strong></h2>Some individuals may have a natural affinity for the occult, which can manifest as heightened sensitivity to astral energies or a stronger connection to their own spiritual faculties. These individuals might be more intuitively attuned to subtle energies, making them more adept at practices like astral sparring or energy manipulation.

<h2>2. <strong>Focused Practice and Dedication</strong></h2>Practitioners who are deeply passionate and dedicated to their practice, even in the early years, may put in more focused effort and time than others who have been practicing for a longer period. This intense dedication can lead to rapid development of skills and a stronger aura or energy presence. In contrast, longer practitioners might have periods of stagnation or less intense focus, impacting their growth.

<h2>3. <strong>Spiritual or Energetic Backgrounds</strong></h2>Some people come into their occult practice with a background that gives them a head start. This could be due to previous lifetimes, ancestral connections to occult practices, or even latent abilities that are quickly awakened upon engaging with occult practices. For example, someone with a lineage that includes shamans, healers, or energy workers might naturally possess stronger energetic abilities.

<h2>4. <strong>Mentorship and Learning Environment</strong></h2>Early practitioners who receive high-quality mentorship or are part of a robust learning community may advance more quickly than those who practice alone or without guidance. A knowledgeable mentor can help them avoid common pitfalls, accelerate their learning process, and provide powerful techniques or rituals that enhance their skills.

<h2>5. <strong>Personal Energetic Composition</strong></h2>Each individual has a unique energetic makeup that can affect their abilities in the occult. Some might naturally have a larger or more vibrant energy body or a more pronounced aura due to their unique spiritual composition. This natural energetic advantage can make their abilities more potent, even with less practice.

<h2>6. <strong>Rapid Evolution and Adaptation</strong></h2>In some cases, newer practitioners might represent a wave of rapid spiritual evolution. As collective human consciousness evolves, individuals are often born with new or enhanced faculties, enabling them to grasp and wield spiritual concepts and energies more readily than those who came before them. This phenomenon can explain why newer practitioners may seem to &quot;outperform&quot; their more experienced counterparts.

<h2>7. <strong>Youthful Energy and Enthusiasm</strong></h2>Younger or newer practitioners might possess a type of energy and enthusiasm that can drive intense spiritual experiences and rapid skill acquisition. This youthful vigor can lead to more potent energetic experiences and a more powerful presence in both the physical and astral realms.

<h2>8. <strong>Fewer Preconceptions and Open-mindedness</strong></h2>Newer practitioners might approach the occult with fewer preconceptions or rigid beliefs about what is possible. This open-mindedness can make them more receptive to new techniques, more innovative in their practice, and more flexible in adapting to different energetic situations, which can enhance their capabilities in ways that more experienced practitioners might not anticipate.

<h2>9. <strong>The Role of Ego and Spiritual Humility</strong></h2>Experienced practitioners sometimes develop strong beliefs about their abilities and their understanding of the occult, which can create an ego barrier. This ego can unintentionally limit growth and the ability to connect with higher or purer energies. In contrast, newer practitioners often approach their practices with a sense of humility and curiosity, which can keep their channels more open and receptive.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279526975823941694 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279526975823941694><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 3:43‚ÄØPM">3:43‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<h2>Disparity of otherkin/reincarnate/incarnate souls</h2>
<h2>1. <strong>Connection to Source Energy</strong></h2>Not all individuals who identify as otherkin (those who feel a deep connection to or believe they possess the essence of non-human entities) have the same depth of connection to their source energy. For some, their identification might be more symbolic or based on personality traits, memories, or an affinity rather than a direct energetic link. Others might have a strong, clear, and continuous connection to the energetic source of their kin, granting them enhanced abilities and power.

<h2>2. <strong>Degree of Integration and Awakening</strong></h2>The level of integration of otherkin energies into one&#39;s being plays a crucial role in determining spiritual strength. Those who have fully awakened and integrated their otherkin aspect might access and utilize those powers more effectively. This includes not only recognizing their otherkin nature but also undergoing spiritual practices or life experiences that align them closely with the energies of that identity. For example, an individual who fully embodies dragon energy might display immense strength, wisdom, or elemental control, akin to what one would expect of a dragon entity.

<h2>3. <strong>Purity and Clarity of Energy</strong></h2>The purity and clarity of the connection to their otherkin nature can vary widely. Some may have a diluted or mixed energy signature, possibly due to a variety of past lives, different spiritual practices, or unresolved energetic blockages. Others may have a pure and unadulterated connection to their otherkin source, allowing them to access that energy in its most potent form. A clear, focused energy signature often correlates with a more powerful presence or ability in spiritual combat or aura projection.

<h2>4. <strong>Ancestral and Soul Lineage</strong></h2>Individuals who carry otherkin energies may have specific ancestral or soul lineages that strengthen their connection to these entities. For instance, someone with a soul lineage tied closely to angels or dragons may inherently possess abilities and strengths linked to that lineage. In contrast, others who identify with otherkin energies might lack this deep ancestral or soul connection, affecting their ability to harness these energies effectively.

<h2>5. <strong>Spiritual Practices and Training</strong></h2>Like any skill, the ability to harness otherkin energies can be developed through dedicated spiritual practice, meditation, energy work, and training in spiritual combat techniques. Those who actively cultivate and train their abilities in alignment with their otherkin nature often demonstrate stronger spiritual power and combat capabilities. In contrast, those without such training might not reach their full potential, regardless of their inherent connection.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279527019960467500 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279527019960467500><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 3:43‚ÄØPM">3:43‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279527252782088204 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279527252782088204><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 3:44‚ÄØPM">3:44‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><h2>6. <strong>Individual Variation and Unique Paths</strong></h2>Each individual‚Äôs spiritual journey is unique. Some people, despite identifying with strong entities like angels or dragons, may focus their spiritual development in areas other than combat or aura manifestation. Their strengths might lie in healing, guidance, or other metaphysical pursuits. Others might naturally gravitate towards spiritual combat and aura strengthening, honing these abilities to exceptional levels.

<h2>7. <strong>Psychological and Emotional Factors</strong></h2>The psychological and emotional state of a practitioner can significantly influence their ability to access and manifest otherkin energies. Confidence, belief in one‚Äôs abilities, emotional clarity, and mental focus are all crucial for effective energy work. Practitioners who are emotionally and mentally aligned with their otherkin identity may manifest stronger abilities than those who have doubts or internal conflicts about their identity.

<h2>8. <strong>Karmic Influence and Past Life Resonance</strong></h2>Some individuals may have past life experiences directly related to their otherkin nature, carrying forward karmic imprints that enhance their abilities. For example, someone with past life experiences as a warrior angel may instinctively have advanced combat capabilities. On the other hand, karmic blocks or unresolved past life issues can hinder an individual‚Äôs ability to fully express their otherkin powers.

<h2>9. <strong>Spiritual Protection and Assistance</strong></h2>Individuals aligned with certain otherkin energies, such as angels or dragons, may receive spiritual protection or guidance from higher beings associated with those energies. This support can enhance their power and presence in both the physical and astral realms. Those without such guidance or who are less attuned may not benefit from these additional boosts.

<h2>10. <strong>Purpose and Soul Mission</strong></h2>Finally, the strength and abilities of otherkin practitioners can also depend on their soul mission or purpose in this lifetime. Those meant to play significant roles in spiritual battles or as protectors might naturally possess or develop greater strength and combat prowess. Others might be here to learn different lessons or serve in non-combative roles, and therefore, their abilities in this specific area might not be as pronounced.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Different types of incarnations/reincarnations</strong>

<h2>1. <strong>Full Incarnation</strong></h2>
<strong>Definition</strong>: A full incarnation occurs when a soul fully embodies a physical body from birth, with its entire essence and consciousness integrated into the physical form. This type of incarnation is the most common and involves a complete blending of the soul&#39;s energy and personality with the human experience.

<strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul><li><strong>Complete Soul Presence</strong>: The entire consciousness and energy of the soul are present in the body, guiding its actions, thoughts, and emotions.</li><li><strong>Life Purpose and Lessons</strong>: Individuals with a full incarnation typically have a clear life purpose and specific lessons to learn. They undergo the full spectrum of human experiences, emotions, and challenges.</li><li><strong>Continuity</strong>: There is a continuous flow of consciousness from the spiritual realm into physical life. The soul enters the body at birth (or before, during fetal development) and remains throughout the entire lifespan, until death.</li><li><strong>Spiritual Growth</strong>: Full incarnations are often meant for comprehensive spiritual growth, karmic resolution, and the expansion of consciousness through the human experience.

<h2>2. <strong>Avatar Incarnation</strong></h2>
<strong>Definition</strong>: An avatar is a special type of incarnation where a highly evolved soul, often considered a divine being or master, incarnates on Earth to fulfill a specific mission, usually to guide humanity, teach spiritual wisdom, or bring about significant change.

<strong>Characteristics</strong>:</li><li><strong>Divine Purpose</strong>: Avatars are usually aware of their divine nature and purpose from an early age. They often possess extraordinary spiritual powers, wisdom, and insight beyond typical human understanding.</li><li><strong>High Consciousness</strong>: Avatars operate at a much higher level of consciousness and maintain a strong connection to the divine or source energy throughout their lives.</li><li><strong>Transformational Role</strong>: They play a significant role in transforming societies, cultures, or spiritual paradigms, often inspiring major religious or spiritual movements.</li><li><strong>Limited Karma</strong>: Unlike typical souls, avatars may not have personal karma to resolve. Instead, they may choose to incarnate to take on collective karma or to provide spiritual guidance.

<h2>3. <strong>Half Incarnation</strong></h2>
<strong>Definition</strong>: A half incarnation involves a soul that only partially embodies a physical form. This means that part of the soul&#39;s consciousness and energy remains in the spiritual realm while the other part resides in the physical body.

<strong>Characteristics</strong>:</li><li><strong>Dual Presence</strong>: The soul is present both in the physical body and the spiritual realm, maintaining a connection between the two.</li><li><strong>Partial Consciousness</strong>: The incarnated portion may have access to higher spiritual insights and knowledge but might feel incomplete or divided, leading to a sense of duality in life.</li><li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Often, half incarnations occur when a soul needs to accomplish specific tasks in both the physical and spiritual realms simultaneously or when there‚Äôs a need for a balance between earthly experiences and spiritual duties.</li><li><strong>Integration Challenges</strong>: Individuals with half incarnations may experience a constant pull between physical and spiritual realities, leading to potential struggles with grounding or fully engaging in the physical world.</li></ul></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279531744546259105 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279531744546259105><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:02‚ÄØPM">4:02‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279532204430725151 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279532204430725151><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:04‚ÄØPM">4:04‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><h2>4. <strong>Partial Incarnation</strong></h2>
<strong>Definition</strong>: A partial incarnation is when only a segment of a soul&#39;s energy or consciousness incarnates into a physical body, with the remaining energy existing in higher realms or other dimensions.

<strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul><li><strong>Limited Soul Presence</strong>: Unlike full incarnations, only a portion of the soul&#39;s essence is present, which can result in specific, focused life missions or experiences.</li><li><strong>Specialized Roles</strong>: These incarnations often have specific purposes, such as healing, guiding, or assisting other souls. The incarnated aspect might focus on developing particular skills or fulfilling certain tasks.</li><li><strong>Fragmented Experience</strong>: Individuals might feel incomplete or as if only part of their true self is present. They might have a heightened sense of otherworldliness or be deeply attuned to non-physical realms.</li><li><strong>Temporary or Specific</strong>: Partial incarnations might be temporary, lasting only as long as needed to fulfill their specific mission or until certain conditions are met.

<h2>5. <strong>Fragments</strong></h2>
<strong>Definition</strong>: Fragments are smaller portions of a soul that incarnate separately from the main soul. These fragments are aspects of a larger soul&#39;s consciousness that take on separate lives, often for the purpose of exploring different experiences or lessons.

<strong>Characteristics</strong>:</li><li><strong>Independent Experience</strong>: Each fragment operates independently, having its own life, personality, and lessons to learn, though they all belong to the same overarching soul.</li><li><strong>Shared Knowledge</strong>: Fragments can share knowledge and experiences with the main soul or other fragments, contributing to the overall growth and understanding of the larger soul.</li><li><strong>Purpose of Expansion</strong>: This type of incarnation allows for a broader range of experiences, enabling the soul to learn and evolve more quickly through multiple simultaneous lives.</li><li><strong>Potential for Reunification</strong>: After the physical experience is complete, fragments may return to and integrate with the main soul, merging their experiences and growth.

<h2>6. <strong>Shards</strong></h2>
<strong>Definition</strong>: Shards are very small, often unintentional fragments of a soul that break off and incarnate. Unlike fragments, which are deliberate divisions, shards may form through traumatic events or significant emotional experiences.

<strong>Characteristics</strong>:</li><li><strong>Trauma-Related</strong>: Shards are often created during times of intense trauma, shock, or distress, where a small part of the soul&#39;s essence breaks away.</li><li><strong>Limited Awareness</strong>: Shards generally have limited consciousness and are more like energetic remnants rather than fully functioning soul pieces.</li><li><strong>Healing Process</strong>: The creation of a shard often indicates that a part of the soul needs healing or integration. The process of healing can involve reclaiming these shards and reintegrating them into the whole soul.</li><li><strong>Role in Karma and Lessons</strong>: Shards can affect the soul‚Äôs karmic balance and often carry unresolved energies or lessons that need to be addressed.</li></ul></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279532240992338091 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279532240992338091><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:04‚ÄØPM">4:04‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279532481665695784 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279532481665695784><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:05‚ÄØPM">4:05‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><h2>7. <strong>Conduits</strong></h2>
<strong>Definition</strong>: Conduits are individuals who serve as channels or mediums for spiritual energies, beings, or forces. While not necessarily incarnations themselves, conduits allow other entities to work through them temporarily or periodically.

<strong>Characteristics</strong>:
<ul><li><strong>Channeling Abilities</strong>: Conduits can temporarily host other spirits, energies, or consciousnesses, allowing these beings to communicate or act through their physical form.</li><li><strong>Temporary Incarnations</strong>: The presence of the external entity is usually temporary, lasting only as long as the channeling session or until a specific purpose is fulfilled.</li><li><strong>High Sensitivity</strong>: Conduits often possess heightened sensitivity to spiritual energies and may require significant grounding and protection to manage these interactions effectively.</li><li><strong>Variety of Entities</strong>: The entities working through a conduit can range from spiritual guides and ancestors to higher beings like angels or interdimensional entities.

<h2>8. <strong>Vessels</strong></h2>
<strong>Definition</strong>: A vessel is a physical body specifically prepared or chosen to host a soul or spirit, either temporarily or permanently. Unlike a full incarnation where a single soul fully occupies a body, a vessel can house multiple entities or energies over time.

<strong>Characteristics</strong>:</li><li><strong>Prepared for Occupation</strong>: The body of a vessel is often spiritually prepared or conditioned to house different energies or souls, either through rituals, spiritual practices, or inherent characteristics.</li><li><strong>Multiple Inhabitants</strong>: Vessels might be occupied by various entities at different times, depending on spiritual agreements or the needs of the beings involved.</li><li><strong>Purpose-Driven</strong>: The use of a vessel is usually for specific purposes, such as carrying out particular missions, hosting multiple guides or entities, or facilitating certain spiritual tasks.</li><li><strong>Clear Consciousness Agreement</strong>: There is often a conscious or unconscious agreement between the vessel and the entities that use it, ensuring harmonious occupation and transition between different presences.

<h2>9. <strong>Hosts</strong></h2>
<strong>Definition</strong>: A host is a physical body that temporarily houses another entity or spirit, similar to a vessel but typically for shorter durations and specific purposes.

<strong>Characteristics</strong>:</li><li><strong>Short-Term Occupation</strong>: Hosts are used for brief periods when a spiritual being needs to interact directly with the physical world, often during rituals, spiritual ceremonies, or healing sessions.</li><li><strong>Voluntary or Involuntary</strong>: Hosting can be a voluntary process where the host consents to the presence of the spirit, or it can occur involuntarily, often due to spiritual sensitivity or lack of boundaries.</li><li><strong>Transitory Nature</strong>: The occupying entity typically does not stay long, as the host‚Äôs primary soul remains dominant and intact. The presence is often fleeting and tied to the completion of a specific spiritual task or message.</li><li><strong>Spiritual Compatibility</strong>: Successful hosting requires compatibility between the host‚Äôs energy and the occupying spirit, ensuring that the temporary presence does not cause harm or imbalance.

<h2>10. <strong>Walk-ins</strong></h2>
<strong>Definition</strong>: A walk-in is a phenomenon where one soul exits a body, and another soul enters, taking over the physical form. This can happen suddenly and without the person being born into the body.

<strong>Characteristics</strong>:</li><li><strong>Soul Exchange</strong>: The original soul departs the physical body (often after a period of trauma, near-death experience, or spiritual agreement), and a new soul takes its place.

<h2>1. <strong>Karma</strong>  </h2>Karma is often described as the law of cause and effect, where actions (both good and bad) in past or present lives influence the circumstances and experiences of future lives. Karma can significantly affect soul development and spiritual abilities, depending on its nature and resolution.

<h2>Types of Karma and Their Effects</h2><ul><li>Good Karma: Positive actions and intentions result in favorable outcomes, growth, and easier paths to spiritual development. Good karma can lead to positive experiences, strong energy, and the enhancement of spiritual abilities. It often supports a soul‚Äôs evolution and increases spiritual awareness and abilities.</li><li>Bad Karma: Negative actions and intentions create challenges and obstacles. Bad karma may manifest as difficulties, suffering, or repeated patterns that hinder personal and spiritual growth. It can block spiritual abilities and create energetic imbalances, making it harder to access higher states of consciousness or develop psychic skills.</li><li>Karmic Blocks: These are unresolved issues from past actions that inhibit growth. Karmic blocks can create stagnation or recurring life challenges until resolved. They may restrict energy flow, limit spiritual perception, and prevent the soul from fully accessing its potential.</li><li>Unresolved Karma: This type of karma involves unresolved lessons or experiences from past lives that carry into the present. These can manifest as phobias, unexplained fears, or relationship dynamics. They can block spiritual growth, disrupt energy, and create cycles of repeated challenges or lessons until the karma is resolved.</li><li>Ancestral Karma: This refers to karmic patterns inherited from one&#39;s family lineage. It can affect the current life by influencing behavior, beliefs, and emotional responses. Ancestral karma can block energy flow, hinder spiritual progress, or burden the soul with unresolved issues passed down through generations.</li></ul>
<h2>Impact on Soul and Energy</h2>
Karma influences the soul&#39;s journey, shaping experiences to facilitate growth and balance. Energetically, karma can cause blockages in the chakra system, the aura, and other subtle bodies, which can affect spiritual practices and the ability to access higher consciousness or spiritual abilities.

<h2>2. Soul Contracts and Agreements</h2>
Soul contracts and agreements are spiritual commitments made before incarnating, outlining the experiences, lessons, and relationships a soul will encounter. These agreements are believed to be designed to support soul growth and the fulfillment of specific purposes.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 11:33‚ÄØAM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279537849145884772 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279537849145884772><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:26‚ÄØPM">4:26‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279538297118392351 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279538297118392351><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:28‚ÄØPM">4:28‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><h2>Types and Their Effects</h2><ul><li>Individual Soul Contracts: These are agreements a soul makes with itself to learn specific lessons or achieve certain goals in a lifetime. They can dictate experiences and challenges that shape spiritual abilities and energy work. Fulfillment of these contracts often leads to the enhancement of spiritual powers and abilities.</li><li>Interpersonal Soul Agreements: Agreements between souls, often involving relationships such as family, friends, or significant others. These relationships can trigger growth, healing, and the development of spiritual abilities through shared experiences, often challenging but ultimately transformative.</li><li>Collective Soul Contracts: These involve agreements made with larger groups, such as communities, nations, or even global collectives. Collective contracts can affect societal dynamics and shared experiences, influencing the collective consciousness and spiritual evolution of humanity.</li></ul>
<h2>Impact on Soul and Spiritual Development</h2>
Soul contracts can dictate the lessons a soul needs to learn, shaping the spiritual abilities they develop. For example, a soul may agree to endure certain hardships to develop empathy or healing abilities. Conversely, a soul might choose to experience abundance to learn generosity or detachment from material wealth.

<h2>3. Effects on Energy, Astral, and Spiritual Powers</h2>
The spiritual principles of karma and soul contracts significantly influence one&#39;s energy, astral abilities, and spiritual powers.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279538326566866996 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279538326566866996><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:28‚ÄØPM">4:28‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:28‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279538493739106345 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279538493739106345><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:29‚ÄØPM">4:29‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><h2>Energy Effects</h2><ul><li>Energy Blockages: Unresolved karma and unfulfilled soul contracts can create energetic blockages, preventing the free flow of energy through the chakras or auric field. This can hinder spiritual practices such as meditation, energy healing, or manifesting abilities and so on and so forth.</li><li>Energetic Imprints: Past life experiences, karma, and soul contracts leave energetic imprints in the aura and subtle bodies, affecting current life energy dynamics. These imprints can cause unexplained emotional reactions or physical symptoms that impact spiritual and energy work.

## Astral and Spiritual Powers </li><li>Astral Abilities: Karma and soul agreements can impact abilities like astral projection or lucid dreaming. For instance, unresolved fears or karmic debts might cause difficulties in leaving the physical body or not having spiritual sight, encountering hostile entities in the astral realm, along with endless other problems.</li><li>Psychic and Spiritual Gifts: Development of psychic abilities (clairvoyance, clairaudience, intuition) can be influenced by the resolution of karmic lessons and soul agreements. Those who work through karmic debts and fulfill their soul contracts may find it easier to access higher states  consciousness and spiritual gifts. But those who do not work through their karmic debts and soul contracts will have difficulty accessing higher states consciousness and their spiritual gifts. </li><li>Spiritual Protection and Guidance: Souls aligned with their karmic path and soul contracts often experience increased spiritual protection and guidance. This alignment supports the development of spiritual abilities by providing insights, synchronicities, and a smoother path to spiritual awakening. On the other hand, those not so aligned with their karmic path and soul contracts may have a less smooth path and experience decreased spiritual support, alignment, and so on.</li></ul></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:31‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279539482181500928 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279539482181500928><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:33‚ÄØPM">4:33‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1279539859253366884 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1279539859253366884><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 31, 2024 4:34‚ÄØPM">4:34‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><h2>4. Healing and Resolution of Karma and Contracts</h2>
To mitigate the negative effects of karma and unfulfilled soul contracts, spiritual practices such as meditation, energy healing, past life regression, and ritual work can be used to resolve karmic debts and fulfill soul agreements--but for some these can take many, many years and through a very grueling effort to achieve. Forgiveness, both of oneself and others, is also a powerful tool in resolving karma. Ancestral healing can address inherited karmic patterns, releasing energetic burdens passed down through generations.

By understanding and addressing these spiritual concepts, a soul can clear blockages, enhance spiritual abilities, and evolve more fully. The path to spiritual development often requires conscious effort to resolve karma, honor soul agreements, and heal energetic imbalances, which in turn opens the door to greater spiritual growth and empowerment, and which in turn also resolve physical issues relating to health, family, wealth, etc.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<h2><strong>Parasitic Entities</strong></h2>
Parasitic entities are perhaps the most pernicious and insidious of all occult beings. These entities feed off the energy of their hosts, often attaching themselves to individuals who are emotionally or spiritually vulnerable. Parasitic entities can manifest in a variety of forms, from subtle energetic drains to more overtly malevolent presences that induce fear, anxiety, or other negative emotions. They thrive on low vibrational energy and are often attracted to individuals who are experiencing prolonged periods of sadness, anger, or fear. 

In many cases, parasitic entities are not particularly intelligent; they are driven by a primal need to sustain themselves. However, their influence can be profound, leading to physical, emotional, and spiritual exhaustion. Removing parasitic entities requires a combination of spiritual cleansing, protection rituals, and often, the intervention of more experienced practitioners who can identify and sever the connection between the entity and its host.

<h2><strong>Trickster Spirits</strong></h2>
Trickster spirits occupy a unique niche in the pantheon of occult entities. These beings are characterized by their cunning, mischievous nature, and ability to deceive and manipulate. In various cultures, trickster spirits are associated with deities like Loki in Norse mythology or Coyote in Native American traditions. However, in the context of the occult, trickster spirits may not always be malevolent. 

Tricksters challenge our perceptions, forcing us to question what we think we know. They may lead practitioners down confusing or contradictory paths, presenting false information or causing events to unfold in unexpected ways. While this can be frustrating or even harmful, the trickster&#39;s ultimate purpose is often to teach valuable lessons about flexibility, adaptability, and the limitations of our knowledge. Working with trickster spirits requires discernment, a sense of humor, and a willingness to embrace uncertainty.

<h2><strong>Lying Spirits</strong></h2>
Lying spirits are entities that deliberately present falsehoods and misinformation. Unlike tricksters, who may deceive for the sake of teaching or revealing deeper truths, lying spirits are more malevolent, seeking to lead practitioners astray for their own purposes. These spirits can be particularly dangerous, as they may masquerade as guides, ancestors, or even higher beings, providing misleading guidance that can cause significant harm.

Lying spirits often prey on the egos and desires of those they encounter, telling people what they want to hear rather than the truth. They can create elaborate illusions or false visions, leading individuals to believe they are receiving divine or spiritual insights when, in reality, they are being manipulated. Discernment, skepticism, and rigorous testing of spiritual experiences are crucial in avoiding the influence of lying spirits.

<h2><strong>Egregores</strong></h2>
Egregores are collective thought forms created and sustained by the shared beliefs and intentions of a group of people. These entities are a product of collective consciousness and can take on a life of their own, influencing the thoughts and actions of those who participate in the group mind. Egregores can be found in various contexts, from religious and spiritual communities to corporations, political movements, and even fandoms.

An egregore is essentially a living entity that embodies the collective energy and intentions of the group that created it. While not inherently malevolent, egregores can become problematic if they are not properly managed or if the collective energy that sustains them becomes negative or unbalanced. In some cases, an egregore can grow powerful enough to exert significant influence over its creators, leading to behaviors and beliefs that may not align with the group&#39;s original intentions.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1280717235979026532 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1280717235979026532><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 10:33‚ÄØPM">10:33‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1280717300969766934 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1280717300969766934><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 10:33‚ÄØPM">10:33‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><h2><strong>False Light Beings</strong></h2>
False light beings are entities that present themselves as beings of light or higher spiritual authority but are, in fact, deceptive and manipulative. These entities often prey on individuals who are seeking spiritual enlightenment or guidance, presenting themselves as angels, ascended masters, or other benevolent beings. However, their true purpose is to divert individuals from their spiritual path, feeding off their energy or leading them into harmful practices.

False light beings are particularly dangerous because they can appear to be positive and loving, making it difficult for even experienced practitioners to recognize their true nature. They often use flattery, promises of power, or visions of divine knowledge to lure individuals into their influence. Protecting oneself from false light beings requires a strong connection to one&#39;s own intuition and inner guidance, as well as regular spiritual cleansing and protection practices.

<h2><strong>God Forms: The Higher Egregore</strong></h2>
God forms represent a more advanced and potent version of egregores. These are archetypal energies that have been invoked, worshipped, and fed by human consciousness over centuries, sometimes millennia. Unlike egregores, which are usually created by a single group, god forms often emerge from entire cultures or civilizations, embodying the collective ideals, fears, and aspirations of a people.

God forms can be incredibly powerful, influencing not only individual lives but also the course of history. They can manifest in various ways, from direct interventions in human affairs to more subtle influences on culture and society. While god forms can be worshipped or invoked for guidance, they are not without their dangers. They can become so deeply intertwined with the identities of their followers that they exert control over them, sometimes leading to fanaticism or extremism.

In the occult context, working with god forms requires a deep understanding of the archetypal energies they represent and a respectful approach to their power. These entities are not merely symbolic; they are potent forces that can have a profound impact on those who engage with them.

<h2><strong>Pretender Entities</strong></h2>
Finally, there are pretender entities‚Äîbeings that assume the guise of more powerful or benevolent entities to deceive and manipulate. These entities can take on the appearance of gods, angels, or other revered spiritual beings, but their intentions are far from divine. Pretender entities may offer false promises, attempt to bind individuals to their will, or lead them down harmful paths.

Pretender entities are often drawn to individuals who are seeking power or knowledge without the necessary discernment or humility. They exploit the weaknesses and desires of those they encounter, leading them to believe they are receiving divine favor or special insight when, in reality, they are being deceived. As with false light beings, the key to avoiding pretender entities is rigorous discernment, humility, and a strong connection to one&#39;s own spiritual authority.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1280718564181020775 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1280718564181020775><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 10:38‚ÄØPM">10:38‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code> 
<strong>Understanding the Complexities of Energy Healing and Manifestation</strong>

<strong>1. The Influence of Past Lives and Karma</strong>

One significant factor that can impact the success of energy healing and manifestation is the influence of past lives and karma. Many spiritual traditions believe that the soul is eternal and undergoes multiple incarnations, each contributing to the soul&#39;s evolution. In this view, unresolved issues, traumas, or lessons from past lives can carry over into the current life, manifesting as energetic blockages or karmic debts. These blockages can hinder the flow of energy necessary for healing or manifestation.

For instance, someone might struggle to manifest abundance in their current life due to a vow of poverty taken in a past life, or they might face recurring health issues stemming from unhealed traumas. Karma, understood as the law of cause and effect, can also play a role. If an individual is experiencing the consequences of negative actions from past lives, they may need to work through this karmic energy before they can fully heal or manifest their desires.

<strong>2. Energy Compatibility and Resonance</strong>

Energy compatibility is another crucial factor in the effectiveness of energy healing and manifestation. Every individual has a unique energy signature shaped by their thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and spiritual development. For energy healing to be effective, the healer&#39;s energy must be compatible with that of the person receiving the healing. If there is a mismatch in frequency or vibration, the healing energy may not be fully absorbed or may even cause discomfort.

Similarly, manifestation relies on the principle of resonance‚Äîlike attracts like. If someone&#39;s energy is not aligned with what they are trying to manifest, they may encounter resistance. For example, a person trying to manifest love might struggle if they harbor deep-seated beliefs of unworthiness or fear of rejection. These internal energies can create a barrier, preventing the manifestation from materializing.

<strong>3. The Need for Self-Healing and Inner Work</strong>

While external energy healing can be incredibly beneficial, it often requires the recipient to engage in self-healing and inner work as well. Healing is not a passive process; it involves active participation in uncovering and addressing the root causes of one&#39;s issues. This can mean facing and healing old wounds, changing limiting beliefs, or releasing attachments that no longer serve the individual&#39;s growth.

Without this inner work, energy healing might offer only temporary relief, as the underlying issues remain unresolved. Similarly, manifestation requires more than just visualizing one&#39;s desires; it demands a shift in mindset, belief systems, and behaviors. If an individual is unwilling or unable to engage in this self-healing process, they may find that their efforts at energy healing and manifestation fall short.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1280719049822699708 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1280719049822699708><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 10:40‚ÄØPM">10:40‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<strong>4. Differences in Polarity and Otherkin Energy</strong>

Finally, differences in polarity and otherkin energy can significantly influence the effectiveness of energy practices. Polarity often refers to the balance of masculine and feminine energies within an individual, but it also encompasses the alignment with positive or negative energy currents‚Äîoften described as the light and dark, or good and evil polarities. These polarities represent different aspects of existence, each with its own energetic qualities and purposes.

Imbalances in polarity can profoundly affect how one interacts with and processes energy. For example, an individual heavily aligned with light or good polarity might struggle to integrate or even understand energies associated with darkness or evil, and vice versa. Healing from one polarity often cannot fully reach or resonate with those deeply rooted in the opposite polarity because the energetic frequencies are fundamentally different. Light-based healing practices, which focus on compassion, purity, and enlightenment, might not penetrate the depths of someone who resonates with dark polarity, where the focus is on power, transformation through adversity, or embracing the shadow self.

Similarly, someone aligned with dark polarity might find that their methods of healing‚Äîoften involving shadow work, facing one&#39;s fears, or embracing one&#39;s darker aspects‚Äîare ineffective or even harmful when applied to someone aligned with light polarity. The different polarities operate on distinct energetic wavelengths, making it difficult for healing energies from one side to fully reach or be accepted by those on the other side.

Otherkin, individuals who identify as non-human in a spiritual or metaphysical sense, may have unique energy signatures that differ from the typical human energy field. This can create challenges in finding compatible energy healers or practices, as conventional methods may not resonate with their energy. Otherkin may require specialized approaches that take into account their unique energetic composition, such as working with specific elemental energies, connecting with their true spiritual origins, or aligning with a polarity that matches their essence.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1280720297598779566 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1280720297598779566><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 10:45‚ÄØPM">10:45‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<h2>Different forms of sparring in the occult </h2>
<h2>1. <strong>Bilocation-Based Sparring</strong></h2>
In bilocation-based sparring, practitioners engage in combat by projecting a part of their consciousness to a specifically tagged location in the astral plane. This location serves as a battleground where participants can manifest their abilities in vivid, highly visual forms. 
<ul><li><strong>Tagged Location:</strong> A predetermined area in the astral realm that acts as the arena for the sparring session. This location is chosen or created to host the energies and manifestations of the participants.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Manifestation:</strong> Practitioners project their astral bodies to this tagged location, bringing with them their spiritual tools, weapons, and abilities. These manifestations are not just symbolic but can interact with and affect the environment, causing damage or creating obstacles.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Damage to the Astral Body:</strong> In this form of sparring, the damage inflicted is on the astral body layer of the participants. This can result in weakened defenses, energetic imbalances, or temporary impairments in one‚Äôs spiritual abilities. The damage may also affect the tagged location, altering the battlefield itself.</li></ul>
<h2>2. <strong>Energetic Combat</strong></h2>
Energetic combat focuses purely on the exchange and manipulation of raw energy between practitioners. It is less about the visual manifestation and more about the flow, strength, and control of energy.
<ul><li><strong>Energy Exchange:</strong> Participants in energetic combat engage by projecting their own energy fields, clashing with the energy of their opponents. The objective is to overpower or destabilize the opponent‚Äôs energy while protecting one‚Äôs own.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Energy Techniques:</strong> Techniques such as energy blasts, shields, and waves are common in this form. Practitioners might also use more subtle methods like energy siphoning, where one participant drains the other‚Äôs energy reserves.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Impact:</strong> The damage here is energetic rather than physical or visual. It can result in fatigue, a sense of depletion, or imbalances in the energy system. Long-term effects might include weakened defenses or difficulty in maintaining energetic stability.</li></ul>
<h2>3. <strong>Intent-Based Combat</strong></h2>
Intent-based combat is all about the sheer force of willpower and the dominance of intent. This form of sparring goes beyond energy manipulation and into the realm of mental and spiritual dominance.
<ul><li><strong>Domination of Intent:</strong> In this sparring form, practitioners exert their will over their opponents. The objective is to break the opponent‚Äôs resolve, fold their intent, and assert one‚Äôs own willpower.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Techniques:</strong> This can involve mental attacks, such as projecting fear or confusion, as well as more direct methods like ‚Äúnuking,‚Äù where one practitioner overwhelms the opponent with an intense burst of intent meant to destroy or subdue, and leave them in long term aphantasia.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Impact:</strong> The damage here is to the practitioner‚Äôs psyche and will. A defeated participant might experience self-doubt, fear, or a loss of confidence in their spiritual abilities for a long time. Long-term consequences might include a weakened ability to manifest desires or assert one‚Äôs will in both spiritual and mundane matters.</li></ul></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1280720391761035316 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1280720391761035316><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 10:45‚ÄØPM">10:45‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<h2>4. <strong>Curse Sparring</strong></h2>
Curse sparring is a highly dangerous and advanced form of astral combat where practitioners engage in the exchange of curses. This is not just a battle in the immediate moment but can have far-reaching effects on the participants‚Äô lives and spiritual practices.
<ul><li><strong>Curses:</strong> Practitioners create and project curses aimed at harming the opponent‚Äôs life, health, spiritual path, or even their soul. These curses are often complex, involving layers of intent and energy designed to attack the opponent on multiple fronts.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Techniques:</strong> Curses might target specific aspects of the opponent‚Äôs life, such as their relationships, finances, or health. More sophisticated curses might attack the opponent‚Äôs spiritual practice, causing them to lose their connection to their spiritual path or hindering their magical abilities.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Impact:</strong> The effects of curse sparring can be devastating and long-lasting. Participants might experience long term or permanent misfortune, illness, or a decline in their spiritual powers. In some cases, the damage might extend to their connections, causing harm to those close to them or disrupting their ability to form new spiritual or magical relationships.</li></ul></span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=Danger><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=Danger src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82alkaid%20%5B1080118381249843310%5D.html_Files/1015330671696285706-EFE39.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1280721563657965568 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1280721563657965568><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 10:50‚ÄØPM">10:50‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<h2><strong>Understanding Damage in Astral Sparring: Why It May Go Unnoticed</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>1. The Influence of Ego</strong></h2>
One of the most significant barriers to recognizing damage in astral sparring is the ego. The ego, in a spiritual context, is often tied to one‚Äôs sense of identity, power, and self-worth. When engaging in an intense or competitive sparring session, a practitioner‚Äôs ego might lead them to deny or downplay any damage they‚Äôve sustained. This denial is a defense mechanism‚Äîacknowledging the damage could be perceived as a weakness or failure, which the ego resists.

For example, a practitioner who identifies strongly with being powerful or invulnerable might subconsciously ignore signs of damage to maintain this self-image. The ego‚Äôs influence can blind the individual to their own vulnerabilities, preventing them from taking the necessary steps to heal or protect themselves after a sparring session.

<h2><strong>2. Lack of Ability to Sense Subtle Energies</strong></h2>
Another reason damage might go unnoticed is a lack of sensitivity to subtle energies. Astral sparring operates on energetic planes that require a heightened sense of awareness to detect shifts, wounds, or imbalances. Not all practitioners have developed the ability to perceive these subtleties. For those still honing their skills in energy work or spiritual sensing, damage may occur without their conscious awareness.

In such cases, the practitioner might not feel any immediate effects or might attribute their feelings of fatigue, imbalance, or emotional turmoil to other causes. Without the ability to detect the finer energetic disturbances, they may miss the signs that indicate damage has been inflicted.

<h2><strong>3. Damage Beyond Perception and Understanding</strong></h2>
Finally, there is the possibility that the damage sustained in astral sparring extends beyond the practitioner‚Äôs current level of perception and understanding. The layers of the energetic body are complex, and some forms of damage might affect deeper or more subtle aspects of one‚Äôs being. For instance, damage could occur at a level that influences the practitioner‚Äôs spiritual path, their connection to certain energies, or their ability to manifest intent‚Äîall of which might not be immediately noticeable.

This type of damage can be particularly insidious, as it may manifest slowly over time, subtly eroding the practitioner‚Äôs capabilities or well-being. If the practitioner‚Äôs awareness does not extend to these deeper layers, they may remain oblivious to the damage until it becomes more pronounced, at which point it might be more challenging to address as time goes on.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1280722571683430451 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1280722571683430451><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 10:54‚ÄØPM">10:54‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<h2><strong>Why Sparring is Not Recommended for Newbies</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>1. Lack of Energy Control and Awareness</strong></h2>
Newbies typically lack the refined control over their energy bodies that experienced practitioners possess. In sparring, the ability to manipulate and protect one‚Äôs energy is crucial. Without this skill, a beginner might unintentionally deplete their energy reserves, create imbalances, or fail to defend against incoming attacks. This can lead to exhaustion, energetic blockages, or even lasting harm.

<h2><strong>2. Vulnerability to Damage</strong></h2>
Inexperienced practitioners are more vulnerable to damage because they may not yet have developed the necessary defenses or coping mechanisms. Sparring can involve harsh exchanges that target the astral body, mental states, or even one‚Äôs spiritual core. Without the ability to properly shield and heal themselves, newbies are at risk of sustaining damage that could hinder their spiritual growth or lead to significant setbacks.

<h2><strong>3. Emotional and Mental Unpreparedness</strong></h2>
Sparring can be mentally and emotionally intense. Newbies might not be prepared for the psychological impact of engaging in such confrontational practices. The stress of facing an opponent, coupled with the fear of harm, can lead to emotional turmoil or mental confusion. This can weaken their resolve and leave them more susceptible to spiritual harm or negative experiences.

<h2><strong>4. Incomplete Understanding of Consequences</strong></h2>
Newbies often lack a full understanding of the long-term consequences of sparring. Unlike physical sparring, the effects of spiritual combat can linger in subtle ways, affecting one&#39;s life, relationships, or spiritual path. Inexperienced practitioners might not recognize these consequences until it is too late, making it difficult to reverse the damage or learn from the experience.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1280723112576548884 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1280723112576548884><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 10:56‚ÄØPM">10:56‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code> 
<h2>5. Ego and the Underestimation of Opponents</h2>Ego can be a significant obstacle for newbies, leading them to overestimate their abilities and underestimate their opponents. In sparring, this can be particularly dangerous. A beginner might not recognize when they have been defeated by a more experienced or powerful practitioner due to their ego-driven belief in their superiority. This lack of awareness can prevent them from learning valuable lessons, leaving them vulnerable to further harm. Additionally, underestimating opponents can lead to carelessness, making them more susceptible to attacks they might otherwise avoid with a more cautious approach.

<h2>6. Severity of Damage and Inability to Heal</h2>In many cases, the damage sustained during sparring can be too severe for a newbie to heal on their own. Advanced practitioners often have the skills and experience to recover from significant spiritual or energetic injuries, but a beginner may lack the necessary healing techniques, energy reserves, or understanding to effectively mend themselves. This can result in long-lasting wounds that might impair their spiritual development or daily life, leading to a prolonged recovery period or the need for external assistance. Such severe damage could set back their progress significantly and discourage them from continuing their practice.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 10:58‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1280724241133736028 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1280724241133736028><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 11:00‚ÄØPM">11:00‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<h2><strong>Karmic Enmeshments and Inherited Karma</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>1. Karmic Ties in Relationships</strong></h2>
When we form deep connections with others, whether through family bonds, romantic partnerships, or close friendships, we may become entangled in their karmic patterns. These karmic ties can cause us to share in the consequences of their actions, both good and bad. For example, a partner with unresolved negative karma might bring challenges or difficulties into our lives, as their karmic energy influences our shared experiences. In some cases, we may even take on some of their karmic burdens, either as a soul contract agreed upon before birth or as a consequence of our emotional and energetic closeness.

<h2><strong>2. Inherited Family Karma</strong></h2>
Inherited karma, often passed down through generations, can manifest as family curses, recurring patterns of bad luck, or emotional and psychological issues that seem to plague an entire lineage. This type of karma is often tied to unresolved issues from ancestors, which can continue to affect their descendants until the underlying karmic debt is addressed and resolved. Individuals might find themselves facing challenges that seem out of proportion to their actions, as they are dealing with the accumulated karma of their forebears. Healing this inherited karma often requires a combination of personal spiritual work and ancestral healing practices.

<h2><strong>3. Influence of Spiritual Entities</strong></h2>
Practitioners who work with spirits, deities, or other metaphysical beings can also be affected by the karmic or energetic baggage of these entities. If a practitioner aligns with a spirit that carries its own unresolved karma or is subject to a curse, this negative energy can spill over into the practitioner‚Äôs life. Similarly, if a spirit is entangled in conflicts or has ties to lower vibrational entities, the practitioner may experience disturbances in their own energy field, leading to bad luck, misfortune, or spiritual setbacks.

<h2><strong>4. Navigating Karmic Enmeshments</strong></h2>
Recognizing and disentangling from karmic enmeshments is crucial for spiritual growth and well-being. This often requires a deep understanding of one‚Äôs own karmic patterns, as well as those of the people and entities one is connected to. Practices such as energy cleansing, ancestral healing, and setting clear spiritual boundaries can help mitigate the impact of inherited karma or external influences. Additionally, fostering self-awareness and mindful detachment in relationships can reduce the risk of absorbing negative karma from others.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<h2><strong>People as Vectors for Chaos in Discord Servers</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>1. Reflecting and Carrying Chaos</strong></h2>
Individuals who are emotionally unstable, harbor unresolved negative energy, or have chaotic personal lives can unconsciously project this chaos onto online communities. Their behavior may disrupt the harmony of a server, leading to arguments, misunderstandings, or widespread discord. In some cases, these individuals may carry chaotic energy that, like a virus, spreads to others in the server, amplifying conflict and instability.

<h2><strong>2. Manipulation by Malicious Practitioners</strong></h2>
Malicious practitioners or hostile entities may target individuals who are vulnerable or energetically compromised to use them as tools for disruption. These individuals can be influenced to act out in destructive ways, often without realizing they are being manipulated. For example, a practitioner might implant thoughts or impulses in a susceptible person, causing them to engage in behavior that undermines the server‚Äôs stability or sows discord among its members.

<h2><strong>3. Entities Using People as Proxies</strong></h2>
Entities with malevolent intent can also use people as proxies to carry out their agendas. These entities might attach themselves to someone who is energetically open or weakened, guiding their actions to create chaos within the server. The affected individual may become a conduit for the entity‚Äôs negative energy, leading to unexplained disturbances, conflicts, or a general sense of unease among the server‚Äôs members.

<h2>4. Targeting by Entities or Practitioners</h2>People can also be specifically tagged by entities or practitioners to be the target of malicious attacks or conflict, akin to a curse but not exactly the same. This targeting involves directing negative energy or influence towards a person to create disturbances while obscuring the true source of the hostility. The targeted individual may become a focal point for discord or conflict, making it difficult for others to trace the root cause of the problems back to the entities or practitioners orchestrating the attacks.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 11:12‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<h2>On Incarnates and Karma</h2>
In the concept of &quot;as above, so below,&quot; an incarnate of a named being burdened with numerous conflicts can indeed become an easy target for sharing and manifesting the entity&#39;s karma. When someone embodies a being with significant conflicts, their energy field is deeply intertwined with the unresolved struggles and negative patterns of that entity. This alignment with the entity&#39;s unresolved karma means that the incarnate may inadvertently attract and perpetuate similar conflicts in their own life.

The principle of &quot;as above, so below&quot; suggests that the higher realms or archetypal energies directly influence and reflect upon the material world. For an incarnate of a conflicted entity, the unresolved issues of that being are not merely abstract but become tangible and persistent in their personal experience. Their energy field, resonating with the entity‚Äôs karma, becomes a conduit for these conflicts, making them more susceptible to repeated patterns and challenges mirroring those of the original being.

This dynamic ensures that the karma of the entity is not only shared but can become permanently etched in the incarnate‚Äôs own energy matrix. As a result, the individual might continuously attract or experience situations that reflect and reinforce the original conflicts, perpetuating a cycle of struggle and resolution that mirrors the entity&#39;s unresolved issues. Thus, the incarnate lives out a reflection of the entity&#39;s karma, illustrating the profound connections between higher archetypal conflicts and their manifestation in the physical world.

Additionally, an incarnate of a conflicted entity might become a target for the adversarial forces and opposing sides associated with that entity. These antagonistic energies can actively seek to influence or manipulate the incarnate, further entrenching the conflicts within their own life. This interaction not only exacerbates the incarnate&#39;s struggles but also irrevocably alters their energy. The continual exposure to and interaction with these adversarial forces can reshape their energy field, embedding the conflict into their very being and perpetuating a cycle of influence and transformation that mirrors the entity&#39;s own adversities. As such, the incarnate‚Äôs energy becomes a battleground, forever altered by the forces of conflict and opposition linked to their archetypal source.

Furthermore, beyond just inheriting the karma of the conflicted entity to which they are tied, an incarnate may also become vulnerable to the karma of the adversarial forces associated with that entity. The principle of &quot;as above, so below&quot; suggests that not only does the incarnate reflect the struggles and unresolved issues of the entity, but they also become a focal point for the negative energies and forces that oppose it. This exposure to adversarial karma means that the incarnate can be influenced and targeted by these opposing forces, further compounding their challenges and deepening their entanglement in the conflict. As a result, the incarnate‚Äôs energy field becomes a conduit for both the entity&#39;s unresolved issues and the antagonistic forces at play.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 11:37‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1280730935037263924 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1280730935037263924><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 11:27‚ÄØPM">11:27‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<h2>On Energy Perception</h2>
Understanding and perceiving energy, especially negative energy, can be complex and often elusive. People might not always grasp how others perceive their energy due to self-perception bias and lack of awareness. Individuals often believe their internal state is transparent and clearly understood by others, leading to a disconnect between their self-image and external perception.

Negative energy, in particular, can be sensed through subtle cues even in digital interactions, such as those on social media platforms like Discord. Energy scanning through text messages or online profiles can reveal underlying emotional currents and intentions, despite the lack of physical presence. Even if someone denies or is unaware of their own negative energy, it can still be felt through the tone, frequency, energy signature that they exude, and content of their messages. People are capable of picking up on these subtle energetic signals, often interpreting them instinctively. Consequently, regardless of an individual‚Äôs denial or attempts to mask their true feelings, their energy, what they are doing in the background or in the dark‚Äîwhether positive or negative‚Äîwill inevitably be sensed through digital communication.

People often overlook the subtlety of negative energy and may place trust in individuals who skillfully mask their true nature behind a facade of sweetness or charm. Such individuals might project a polished image or engage in behaviors that seem benign, yet their true intentions can be harmful or manipulative. This deceptive exterior can obscure their vampiric tendencies or other hidden and disruptive motives, leading to misplaced trust and vulnerability among those who are not attuned to these subtler energetic cues. As a result, communities and individuals may be drawn to or distracted by the seemingly friendly front, failing to recognize the underlying negative energy and potential harm. This highlights the importance of discernment and awareness in interactions, as the true nature of a person&#39;s energy can be hidden beneath a carefully crafted exterior.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 3, 2024 11:31‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<h2>Black Goo: Personal Commentary</h2>
The idea of black goo in the occult, especially after 2016, really resonates with me as a powerful symbol of corruption. It&#39;s like this dark, viscous substance that feels almost alive, creeping into places where it doesn‚Äôt belong and tainting everything it touches. For me, it represents the kind of corruption that‚Äôs not just physical but deeply spiritual‚Äîa sort of moral and energetic decay that‚Äôs hard to shake off once it takes hold.

When I think about black goo, it reminds me of the dangers that lurk in the darker corners of the occult. We all know there are risks involved in exploring forbidden knowledge or interacting with malevolent forces, but black goo takes those risks to another level. It‚Äôs not just about slowly losing your way; it‚Äôs about something far more aggressive and insidious. This substance doesn‚Äôt give you time to notice you‚Äôre being corrupted‚Äîit just overwhelms you, spreading like a virus through your spirit or practice until you‚Äôre completely consumed by it.

What really gets to me is how black goo reflects our fears about losing control. As practitioners, we like to think we‚Äôre in charge of the energies we work with, but black goo shatters that illusion. It‚Äôs a stark reminder that darkness can be far more powerful and cunning than we expect. It feeds on our vulnerabilities, turning them against us until we‚Äôre no longer ourselves but vessels for something darker and more dangerous.

I can‚Äôt help but see black goo as a metaphor for what happens when negative influences infiltrate spiritual practices or communities. It‚Äôs like a spiritual infection, spreading corruption that‚Äôs hard to root out once it‚Äôs taken hold. And in a way, it feels like a reflection of the anxieties many of us have felt in recent years‚Äîthis sense that the world is changing in ways we can‚Äôt control, and that darkness is finding new ways to seep into our lives and practices.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, September 6, 2024 11:21‚ÄØAM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<h2>Natural Deity Matron/Patron vs Chosen Deity Matron/Patron </h2>
A natural deity matron or patron refers to a deity that is inherently aligned with your soul from the very beginning. This alignment might be due to your soul&#39;s nature, past lives, or an intrinsic connection that has always existed, even before you became aware of it. This type of deity is often seen as a guiding force that has been with you throughout your spiritual journey, influencing your path and the lessons you encounter in life.

Key Characteristics of Natural Deity Matrons/Patrons:

Innate Connection: You might feel a deep, instinctual bond with this deity, even without consciously choosing or seeking them out.

Alignment with Soul: The qualities, values, and domains associated with this deity naturally resonate with your core being.

Past Life Connection: There could be a link to your previous incarnations where you worked with or were guided by this deity, and that connection continues into your current life.

Influence Throughout Life: This deity may have played a role in shaping your life‚Äôs purpose, challenges, and growth, often without you realizing it.

<h2>Difference from Chosen or Called Deity Matrons/Patrons:</h2>
<h2>1. Chosen/Called Deities:</h2>
Conscious Decision: You may feel drawn to or choose a deity based on your current spiritual needs, experiences, or aspirations.

Active Seeking: This involves a deliberate choice where you resonate with a deity&#39;s domain, values, or the role they play in mythology or spirituality.

Dynamic Relationship: The connection with a chosen deity can evolve over time, based on your growth, changing circumstances, or spiritual exploration.

Contemporary Relevance: These deities might align with your current goals, challenges, or the phase of life you‚Äôre in.

<h2>2. Natural Deity Matrons/Patrons:</h2>
Pre-existing Bond: This connection exists independent of your current life choices and may have been present from birth or before, suggesting a deeper spiritual lineage.

Soul Alignment: These deities are inherently linked to your soul‚Äôs essence, meaning their qualities and domains are a fundamental part of who you are.

Lifelong Guidance: This deity often plays a consistent role throughout your life, regardless of your conscious awareness or spiritual practices.

Ancestral or Karmic Ties: There might be ancestral ties or karmic reasons for this connection, such as a vow, a relationship from a past life, or a role in your spiritual evolution across lifetimes.

<h2>Why the Difference Matters:</h2>
Understanding whether a deity is a natural matron/patron or one you feel called to or choose can deepen your spiritual practice. A natural deity may provide insights into your soul&#39;s journey across lifetimes, offering guidance that feels inherently aligned with your true self. Meanwhile, a deity you choose or feel called to can address specific needs or challenges in your current life, providing focused support during particular phases of your spiritual development.

In summary, a natural deity matron/patron is more about a deep, innate connection tied to your soul&#39;s essence, possibly across multiple lifetimes. In contrast, a chosen or called deity matron/patron involves a more conscious decision based on your current spiritual journey.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Parallel Lives</strong> suggests that our existence is not confined to a single linear path but rather intersects with multiple simultaneous realities. Each parallel life represents a different trajectory based on the choices we make or the circumstances we encounter. This concept posits that while we are navigating our current reality, other versions of ourselves are experiencing alternative outcomes in parallel dimensions. This framework allows for the exploration of various aspects of our potential and the impact of different decisions on our overall spiritual evolution.

<strong>Past Lives</strong> refer to the belief that our souls have lived through multiple incarnations before the present moment. These previous existences are thought to influence our current life, shaping our personality, talents, and challenges. Understanding past lives can offer insights into unresolved issues, karmic patterns, and the continuity of our spiritual growth. This perspective emphasizes the cyclical nature of existence and the idea that our spiritual journey is ongoing, with each lifetime serving as a chapter in a larger narrative.

<strong>Future Selves</strong> encompass the concept of potential futures and the evolving nature of our identity. Rather than a fixed destiny, future selves represent the various possibilities that lie ahead based on our current choices and actions. This idea encourages a proactive approach to personal development, suggesting that by aligning with our higher aspirations and making conscious decisions, we can shape our future selves and navigate toward a more fulfilling path.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, September 15, 2024 8:07‚ÄØAM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Several key factors contribute to this confusion:

<strong>1. Evolution of Religious and Mythological Narratives</strong>

Many of these figures come from distinct traditions but have been merged over time.

Lilith originates from Mesopotamian and Jewish folklore, evolving from a storm demon (Lilu/Lilitu) into the rebellious first wife of Adam in later Jewish texts.

Samael appears in Jewish mysticism as an angel of death, an accuser, or even a consort of Lilith, but he is distinct from Satan in most traditional texts.

Lucifer was originally a Roman term for the morning star (Venus) and only became associated with a fallen angel due to a misinterpretation of Isaiah 14:12.

Satan evolved from a role (the adversary or accuser) in Jewish texts into a personified fallen angel in Christian theology.

<strong>2. Christian Demonization and Later Esoteric Reinterpretations</strong>

Many of these figures were demonized in medieval Christian theology, where different entities were blurred together as enemies of God.

In Kabbalistic and Gnostic traditions, Samael was sometimes portrayed as a dark force with complex, ambiguous roles.

19th- and 20th-century occult groups, like Theosophy and certain Left-Hand Path traditions, started reinterpreting Lucifer as a Promethean figure of enlightenment rather than a fallen angel.

<strong>3. New Age and Pop Culture Conflation</strong>

The New Age movement often pulls from various religious, esoteric, and mystical traditions without strict adherence to historical sources. This leads to mixing Lilith, Samael, Lucifer, and Satan into a single &quot;rebel deity&quot; archetype, despite their distinct origins.

Pop culture (books, movies, and TV shows) further reinforces and spreads these misconceptions by simplifying or dramatizing these figures.

<strong>4. Internet Echo Chambers and Misinformation Spread</strong>

Many modern spiritual practitioners rely on online sources, where misinformation spreads easily.

Simplified and aesthetically appealing narratives (e.g., &quot;Lucifer is a misunderstood light-bringer&quot; or &quot;Lilith was the first feminist&quot;) gain traction, even if they lack  historical accuracy.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1343148579463893123 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1343148579463893123><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, February 23, 2025 4:12‚ÄØAM">4:12‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1343149865408008222 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1343149865408008222><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, February 23, 2025 4:18‚ÄØAM">4:18‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>UPG, VPG and SPG</strong></em>

Here&#39;s a breakdown of the three main categories within each:

<strong>1. UPG (Unverified Personal Gnosis)</strong>

UPG refers to spiritual insights, experiences, or revelations that an individual receives but are not widely documented in historical or traditional sources. These are highly personal and subjective.

Personal Revelations ‚Äì Direct messages from deities, spirits, or ancestors that do not appear in established lore.

Experiential Knowledge ‚Äì Feelings, visions, or energy work results unique to the practitioner, such as perceiving a deity with attributes different from recorded myths.

Uncommon Symbolism ‚Äì Seeing a god or spirit associated with colors, numbers, or symbols that are not traditionally linked to them.

<strong>2. VPG (Verified Personal Gnosis)</strong>

VPG refers to personal gnosis that has been confirmed through multiple independent sources, either by other practitioners receiving the same message or by historical texts aligning with personal experiences.

Community Confirmation ‚Äì Multiple unrelated practitioners report similar spiritual messages or interactions with a being.

Cross-Referencing with Lore ‚Äì A personal insight later aligns with a historical, folkloric, or mythological source the practitioner was previously unaware of.

Esoteric Tradition Recognition ‚Äì Established occult groups or mystery schools acknowledge a personal gnosis as aligning with their teachings.

<strong>3. SPG (Shared Personal Gnosis)</strong>

SPG is a middle ground where multiple people independently receive the same insight, but it is still not historically verified. It holds more weight than UPG but is not as strong as VPG.

Group Spiritual Messages ‚Äì A deity or entity communicating a consistent message to different people.

Synchronicities Across Practitioners ‚Äì People in different locations experiencing similar visions or dream messages.

Emerging New Traditions ‚Äì When many practitioners incorporate a new insight into their practice, leading to its wider acceptance over time.

<em><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></em>

UPG is personal and should not be imposed on others.

VPG is stronger because it has independent verification.

SPG is a potential bridge between UPG and VPG.</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=thumbsup><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=üëç src=%F0%9D%96%9C%F0%9D%96%94%F0%9D%96%91%F0%9D%96%8B%F0%9D%96%8D%F0%9D%96%8E%F0%9D%96%9B%F0%9D%96%8A%E2%82%8A%CC%A3%CC%87%C2%B9%E2%81%B8%E2%81%BA%20-%20%E2%9C%A6%E2%96%88%20Mind%20Motes%20-%20%F0%9F%9B%82alkaid%20%5B1080118381249843310%5D.html_Files/1f44d-27259.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>1. Survivorship Bias ‚Äì The Hidden Failures of the Occult</strong>

What It Is:
Survivorship bias occurs when people focus only on successful or extraordinary cases while ignoring the failures or mundane results. This leads to skewed perceptions of what works in the occult.

How It Manifests in the Occult:

People share successful spells or rituals but rarely document the ones that failed or had no result.

Stories of spiritual awakenings, entity encounters, or powerful initiations dominate discussions, being able to handle extreme forms of damages in astral spars,  making it seem like they are common experiences.

Practitioners believe certain grimoires, traditions, experiences, or deities are &quot;proven&quot; to personally work simply because those who failed to get results don‚Äôt speak up.

Why It Happens:

Social media and forums reward sensational content over mundane reality.

New practitioners want validation, so they seek out and repeat successful narratives.

Failure is often seen as a sign of personal weakness or incorrect practice rather than a natural part of learning.

Consequences:

Unrealistic expectations for results, leading to frustration or disillusionment.

People may abandon useful practices too quickly if they don‚Äôt see immediate success.

Blind faith in certain methods or teachers without recognizing their limitations.

How to Counter It:

Actively seek out both successes and failures when evaluating a practice.

Maintain a personal journal, recording all results‚Äîgood, bad, and neutral.

Engage in communities that encourage open discussions about failure.

<strong>2. Sunk Cost Fallacy ‚Äì The Trap of Commitment</strong>

What It Is:
The sunk cost fallacy is when people continue investing in a belief, practice, or system simply because they‚Äôve already put significant time, effort, or money into it, even if it&#39;s not yielding results.

How It Manifests in the Occult:

Staying committed to a magical system, spiritual path, or teacher even when it stops being effective, simply because of prior investment.

Defending outdated or ineffective practices because abandoning them would mean admitting wasted time.

Practitioners refusing to adjust their beliefs, even when faced with contrary evidence.

Why It Happens:

Ego attachment‚Äîadmitting something doesn‚Äôt work feels like a personal failure.

Fear of wasted effort‚Äîpeople would rather believe their time and money were well spent.

Community pressure‚Äîleaving a tradition may mean losing social support or status.

Consequences:

Stagnation‚Äîpeople get stuck in ineffective methods instead of evolving.

Financial loss‚Äîcontinuously spending money on expensive courses, readings, or tools that don&#39;t provide value.

Spiritual frustration‚Äîstaying in a practice that no longer aligns with one‚Äôs growth.

How to Counter It:

Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of practices with a critical mindset.

Recognize that changing paths is not failure but growth.

Set checkpoints for reassessment‚Äîask yourself, &quot;Is this still benefiting me?&quot; every few months.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, February 23, 2025 10:59‚ÄØAM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1343250668311416943 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1343250668311416943><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, February 23, 2025 10:58‚ÄØAM">10:58‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1343250823810912266 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1343250823810912266><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, February 23, 2025 10:59‚ÄØAM">10:59‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>3. Dunning-Kruger Effect ‚Äì The Overconfidence of the Practitioner</strong>

What It Is:
The Dunning-Kruger effect describes how people with little experience overestimate their competence, while those with deep knowledge tend to underestimate themselves.

How It Manifests in the Occult:

Newcomers confidently proclaim their knowledge after reading a few books, dismissing experienced practitioners.

People assume their first few successful spells mean they have &quot;mastered&quot; magic.

Individuals create grand theories or new occult systems without deep research or practice.

The opposite can also occur‚Äîexperienced practitioners doubting their knowledge due to increased awareness of complexities.

Why It Happens:

The initial exposure to occult knowledge gives a false sense of mastery.

Online communities often reward confidence over depth, amplifying misinformation.

Beginners lack the awareness to recognize what they don‚Äôt know.

Consequences:

Spread of misinformation‚Äîoverconfident newcomers may mislead others.

Frustration‚Äîpeople expect fast results and become discouraged when real mastery takes years.

Experienced practitioners may doubt themselves, leading to imposter syndrome.

How to Counter It:

Encourage a mindset of lifelong learning‚Äîacknowledge that knowledge is always evolving.

Some people are just wired differently when it comes to time. Like, they‚Äôre not just living their lives‚Äîthey‚Äôre tied to the way timelines play out

There are the <em><strong>anchors</strong></em>‚Äîthe ones who hold things steady. When something shifts in the timeline or reality gets messed with, they feel it. Like a deep discomfort in their chest, or a sense that something&#39;s wrong even if they can‚Äôt explain it. They‚Äôre the ones who ground reality, whether they know it or not

Then there are the <em><strong>walkers</strong></em>‚Äîthe ones who drift between timelines, or kind of live with one foot in this world and the other in another version of it. They get weird flashes of things that never happened, remember pieces of lives they haven‚Äôt lived (at least not here), or feel like someone else‚Äôs memories are brushing up against theirs. Sometimes it‚Äôs past lives. Sometimes it‚Äôs alternate versions of themselves trying to be heard

Neither one‚Äôs better‚Äîthey‚Äôre just different roles in the bigger picture</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:17‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361812626790809841 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361812626790809841><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:17‚ÄØPM">5:17‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361813622321578167 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361813622321578167><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:21‚ÄØPM">5:21‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Basic of Basic: Grounding</strong>

Grounding is really just a way of bringing yourself back into your body and the present moment‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre feeling scattered, anxious, or like your energy‚Äôs been pulled in too many directions. It doesn‚Äôt have to be spiritual or complicated. Think of it more like recharging your internal battery and plugging yourself back into something steady

One of the simplest ways to ground is to just step outside and get your feet on the earth. Grass, dirt, concrete‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt really matter. Just feeling the ground beneath you helps remind your body that you‚Äôre here, now. You don‚Äôt need to meditate or do anything specific. Just stand there, breathe, and let yourself be

Another good trick is to hold something physical. It could be a stone, a crystal, a warm mug, or anything with weight and texture. Focus on how it feels in your hand. The weight, the texture, the temperature. That simple act pulls you out of your head and into your senses. Same thing goes for eating‚Äîgrab something earthy like bread, nuts, chocolate, or fruit. Take your time with it. Taste it fully. Let your body experience it. That‚Äôs grounding too

Breathing helps more than most people think. Try slowing your breath down‚Äîdeep inhale through your nose, hold for a couple seconds, then a slow exhale through your mouth. Do that a few times and picture your breath dropping down into your body, like roots growing from your feet into the earth. You‚Äôll start to feel heavier, calmer, more present

Water works really well too. Washing your hands, taking a shower, or splashing cold water on your face‚Äîanything like that can help reset your energy. When you do it with intention, even just thinking ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm back now‚Äù while you rinse off, it can make a huge difference

Grounding doesn‚Äôt have to look like anything special. It‚Äôs more about reconnecting with yourself and the world around you in a way that feels steady and real. Once you start practicing it, you‚Äôll notice when you‚Äôre ungrounded faster, and it becomes way easier to get back to center</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Know thyself‚Äîbefore anything else</strong>
Your personal bias, trauma, desires, and fears can all color what you think you‚Äôre sensing. One of the biggest traps is mistaking inner projections for external truths. Discernment starts with shadow work‚Äîbeing honest about your blind spots, triggers, and fantasies so they don‚Äôt run the show during spiritual work

<strong>Energy doesn‚Äôt lie‚Äîbut interpretation can</strong>
Learn to feel energy first without assigning it a name or story. Is it cold? Heavy? Erratic? Sweet but sharp? Not every dark-feeling presence is evil, and not every light-feeling one is ‚Äúgood.‚Äù Some things feed off praise. Others wear masks. Practice observing first. Interpretation should come after you‚Äôve sat with the raw sensation

<strong>Test spirits and energies, don‚Äôt just trust them</strong>
In occult practice, you can challenge or question what shows up. Ask names. Demand clarity. Use your wards. If something gets offended by that, that‚Äôs a red flag. Real allies don‚Äôt mind boundaries or questions. Tricksters and parasites, on the other hand, often push urgency or try to flatter your ego

<strong>Gnosis should grow, not just gratify</strong>
If a message or spirit is constantly telling you what you want to hear, but never challenges you, expands you, or teaches something deeper‚Äîit may not be what it seems. Real spiritual growth involves discomfort, not just feel-good affirmations. Discernment helps you spot the difference between true insight and spiritual fluff</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361816490810150933 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361816490810150933><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:32‚ÄØPM">5:32‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361816769563459806 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361816769563459806><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:33‚ÄØPM">5:33‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Cross-check everything</strong>
Keep notes. Track patterns. Confirm with multiple sources: dreams, divination, other practitioners you trust. If the signs and signals are consistent across time and modality, that‚Äôs a good sign. But if the story keeps changing, or relies only on intense emotional highs, take a step back

<strong>Discernment doesn‚Äôt mean paranoia</strong>
Don‚Äôt let discernment turn into fear of everything. Some people get stuck in ‚Äúeverything is a trap‚Äù mode, which kills trust and flow. The key is balance‚Äîbeing open enough to receive, but rooted enough not to be swept away

<strong>Protect your baseline</strong>
The stronger your grounding, cleansing, and shielding practices are, the clearer your channel will be. When your space and energy are stable, it‚Äôs way easier to notice what‚Äôs foreign or off. If your foundation is shaky, everything starts to blur</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361816799544611128 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361816799544611128><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:33‚ÄØPM">5:33‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361817691337527349 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361817691337527349><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:37‚ÄØPM">5:37‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Warding</strong>

Warding is basically the spiritual version of locking your doors and setting boundaries. It‚Äôs how you keep your space (and your energy) protected from stuff that doesn‚Äôt belong‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs stray spirits, unwanted energy, parasites, or even just people‚Äôs leftover emotional gunk. It‚Äôs not about being paranoid, it‚Äôs about having energetic hygiene. Like, you wouldn&#39;t leave your house wide open at night, right? Same vibe

A good ward is like a filter. It doesn‚Äôt stop everything, but it knows what to let in and what to keep out. You can ward your room, your home, your body, your tools‚Äîwhatever feels like yours. And they don‚Äôt have to be complicated, either. You can build a ward with intention, a few spoken words, a sigil on your door, a circle of salt, a glass of water, an item that holds power for you‚Äîwhatever gets the job done

The key is intent + reinforcement. Wards aren‚Äôt always permanent. Think of them like shields‚Äîthey weaken over time, especially if you‚Äôre dealing with a lot of energy or working in high-spirit areas. Check them regularly. Feed them. Cleanse them. Update them as you grow, because your energy changes too

Also‚Äîyour wards don‚Äôt have to be aggressive unless you want them to be. Some people build theirs to bounce things back, some to just dissolve junk as it comes in, some to gently nudge things away. It‚Äôs your space. You decide the rules

And trust me: even if you don‚Äôt see them working, you‚Äôll feel the difference when they‚Äôre up and strong. The air feels clearer. Sleep gets better. Weird vibes don‚Äôt stick. And if something does try to get in, you‚Äôll know it‚Äîand your wards will usually give you the heads-up before it becomes a problem</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361818188102369341 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361818188102369341><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:39‚ÄØPM">5:39‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<strong>Veiling</strong>

Veiling is kind of like warding‚Äôs sneaky cousin. Where warding is about keeping things out, veiling is more about keeping yourself hidden or protected energetically‚Äîlike throwing on a spiritual cloak so you‚Äôre not wide open to everything around you. Think of it like putting your phone on ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù mode, but for your aura

People veil for all kinds of reasons: to avoid attracting attention from spirits, to move through crowded or energetically intense spaces without picking stuff up, or to keep their personal power from leaking out. Some folks who are very energetically ‚Äúloud‚Äù (or just super sensitive) veil to keep themselves from getting drained or noticed. It‚Äôs not about fear‚Äîit‚Äôs about control and choosing when and where you want to be seen or felt

You can veil your energy, your thoughts, your spiritual signal‚Äîeven your dreams. It‚Äôs not always literal, like a cloth over your head (though some people use that too). It can be done with intention, visualization, sigils, charms, or even scent. Some visualize a foggy mist wrapping around their energy, some put on specific jewelry charged to mask their vibe, and others build it right into their morning routine‚Äîlike brushing your hair and brushing your aura

The beauty of veiling is it‚Äôs subtle. It doesn‚Äôt block you off from your power‚Äîit just helps you choose who gets to read you. It‚Äôs especially useful if you‚Äôre doing heavy spiritual work and want to stay low-key afterward, or if you‚Äôre feeling too exposed from dreams, rituals, or energy scans. You can even layer it with your wards‚Äîwards keep stuff out, veils keep you from broadcasting

And like with wards, veils need upkeep. Refresh them, check them, and reapply if you‚Äôve had a rough day or done any intense magic. You‚Äôll know when it‚Äôs wearing thin‚Äîpeople might start acting weird around you, you might feel extra visible or drained, or you‚Äôll just get that inner nudge like, ‚ÄúTime to throw the veil back on&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361818883631218810 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361818883631218810><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:42‚ÄØPM">5:42‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361819089743642707 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361819089743642707><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:42‚ÄØPM">5:42‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>Shard Holders and Incarnates</strong>

<strong>Shard Holders</strong> are people who carry a piece of something bigger. That could be a fragment of a deity, an ancient spirit, a cosmic force, or even an entity that no longer exists in full. The point is, they‚Äôre not fully that being‚Äîthey‚Äôre carrying a shard, like a spark or echo that lives within their soul or energy body. Sometimes it‚Äôs dormant, sometimes it‚Äôs active, sometimes it slowly awakens over time

Being a shard holder doesn‚Äôt always mean you‚Äôre ‚Äúchosen‚Äù in some dramatic way‚Äîit just means your soul picked something up along its travels, or was entrusted with it for a reason. Some shard holders feel like they‚Äôre here to protect, awaken, or even integrate those pieces. Others feel like they‚Äôre just trying to carry them without burning out. The energy can be heavy or intense. It can change how you experience the world, especially if it‚Äôs from a very old, divine, or powerful origin

Then you‚Äôve got <strong>Incarnates</strong>‚Äîthese are a little different. Incarnates are that being, but living a human life. They‚Äôre full-soul returns of a deity, spirit, or otherworldly force that chose to incarnate on purpose. Sometimes they know right away, sometimes it unfolds slowly. Incarnates often have a sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu with spiritual concepts, strange innate wisdom, or heavy past-life recall. There‚Äôs usually a strong calling, an internal pressure to do something important, even if they don‚Äôt fully know what yet

The line between a shard holder and an incarnate isn‚Äôt always super clear at first. Some people start as shard holders and become more incarnate-like as the connection deepens or awakens. Some never ‚Äúmerge‚Äù with the being they carry‚Äîand they don‚Äôt have to. You‚Äôre still you, and your sovereignty matters. Just because you hold or reflect something divine doesn‚Äôt mean you lose your personal identity

Both paths come with intensity‚Äîspiritual lessons, trials, identity shifts, deep existential moments. And they can bring gifts too: healing, insight, channeling, and sometimes raw power. But none of it replaces the need for grounding, discernment, and balance. Especially because egos can flare fast when power gets involved. The goal isn&#39;t to become ‚Äúmore‚Äù than others‚Äîit‚Äôs to understand what you are, and carry it well</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361819896752771124 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361819896752771124><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:46‚ÄØPM">5:46‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<strong>Otherkin</strong>

Otherkin are people who identify‚Äîspiritually, energetically, or soul-deep‚Äîas something other than fully human. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre delusional or pretending to be something they‚Äôre not; not always. It‚Äôs more like, at the soul level, they‚Äôre carrying the essence, memory, or resonance of a different kind of being. Maybe a dragon, fae, elf, demon, angel, elemental, or something else that doesn‚Äôt even have a name here

Some Otherkin believe their soul was never human in origin. Others think they were that being in a past life or parallel existence, and that imprint is still very much active. And for a lot of people, it‚Äôs a blend‚Äîancestral memory, spiritual ties, soul contracts, and reincarnation all mashed together</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361820257735676099 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361820257735676099><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:47‚ÄØPM">5:47‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<strong>Starseeds</strong>

Starseeds are souls believed to have originated from other planets, dimensions, or star systems‚Äînot just metaphorically, but literally. Think: Pleiadians, Lyrans, Arcturians, Sirians, Andromedans, and even more abstract or non-humanoid consciousnesses

They usually incarnate on Earth during specific windows of time to assist with evolution, healing, or bringing in higher frequency codes. Not all of them remember where they‚Äôre from, but they feel the pull. And Earth? It often feels dense, messy, and exhausting to them</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1361820713144684697 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1361820713144684697><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 15, 2025 5:49‚ÄØPM">5:49‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>
<strong>Notes about all of the above; 
Just because someone aligns with one of these doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre ‚Äúbetter,‚Äù spiritually elite, or destined to save the world and other grandeur in purpose. It‚Äôs not about ego. These terms are frameworks to help people remember their soul origins, gifts, and why they might feel different. But it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in labels, larp, delusions, imaginations, and forget the point‚Äîintegration

If you resonate with one or more of these, that‚Äôs valid. A lot of people are hybrids or crossovers. Some people grow out of a label as they evolve. Some don‚Äôt need a label at all, they just know

<strong>Vetting</strong>

<em><strong>So, what‚Äôs vetting, and why do we even bother?</strong></em>

Honestly, vetting is just the spiritual version of not taking things at face value. Just like you wouldn‚Äôt give your house keys to someone you barely know, you don‚Äôt want to let just any spirit, energy, or person into your practice or personal space without checking them out first.

In <em>spiritual / occult</em> communities, not everyone is your friend, no matter how nice their words or texts are, even if they put up a nice front, it might be a mask, <em>so be aware</em>

Let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî giving someone permission to scan your energy, aura, or spirit body is intimate. You‚Äôre literally letting them into your energetic house. If they‚Äôre unskilled, careless, or have shady intentions, they can cause more harm than help. That‚Äôs why vetting energy scanners is crucial. Not every reader is clear, honest, or even safe to work with. Some people mean well but don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing and might misread your energy or project their own stuff onto you. Others might fish for information to manipulate, or worse, they could actually disturb your energetic field if they‚Äôre carrying attachments or running off corrupted systems

When I‚Äôm considering letting someone scan or read me, I always feel out their vibe first. I pay attention to their tone, how they talk about others, and how they explain their process. Do they empower the people they read? Or do they create fear, dependency, or act like they‚Äôre the only one with answers? I also ask myself: Does this person feel grounded and clean in their own energy? If someone seems chaotic, bitter, or overly ego-driven, I won‚Äôt let them in ‚Äî no matter how accurate they claim to be. It‚Äôs also okay to ask questions before a reading: ‚ÄúWhat kind of energy do you work with? What happens if you see something dark or intense? How do you protect yourself and the people you read for?‚Äù Their answers will tell you a lot

And if someone insists on scanning you without permission, throws readings at you you didn‚Äôt ask for, or uses fear to lure you into follow-ups? That‚Äôs a no. Healthy practitioners respect consent and boundaries ‚Äî they don‚Äôt fish, they don‚Äôt push, and they definitely don‚Äôt claim they ‚Äújust had to tell you‚Äù something dramatic. Energy work should always be collaborative, not invasive</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>Destiny Stealers, Destiny Swappers and Copy Cats</strong>

<strong>Destiny Stealers</strong>
These are folks (or entities) that try to hijack your path‚Äîyour opportunities, blessings, talents, even relationships. Sometimes it&#39;s spiritual interference, sometimes it&#39;s people doing workings (intentionally or not) to live out something that was originally meant for you. Think of it like someone sidestepping their own timeline and tapping into yours. It‚Äôs parasitic, but often dressed up like admiration, envy, or even love. You‚Äôll hear people say, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre living off my energy,‚Äù or ‚Äúthey‚Äôre walking a path that was meant for me.‚Äù

<strong>Destiny Swappers</strong>
This one‚Äôs weirder. It‚Äôs more like a trade, but usually not mutual or consented. One person‚Äôs fate or karmic debt gets pushed onto someone else, either through rituals, soul contracts, trauma bonds, or spiritual trickery. Some of this can be inherited stuff too‚Äîfamily curses, ancestral baggage, that kind of thing. In more manipulative cases, someone might swap their mess onto someone ‚Äúlighter‚Äù or more fortunate, and walk off with their ease while the other person drowns in obstacles

<strong>Copycats</strong>
This one‚Äôs pretty common. It‚Äôs when someone mimics your style, words, spiritual path, persona‚Äîon the surface it just looks like imitation, but energetically it can be more than that. Some people copy as a form of identity theft on a soul level, especially in the occult. They want your essence, not just your aesthetic. In deeper cases, they try to become you, energetically, socially, and magically. It can cause confusion, identity issues, even weird luck shifts or ‚Äúwhy does it feel like I‚Äôm fading while they‚Äôre thriving?‚Äù moments</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1362449518628569099 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1362449518628569099><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 17, 2025 11:27‚ÄØAM">11:27‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>I encountered these ideas while trying to prove that there were people attempting doing these to me through my time in the occult, but so far it backfired or failed horribly; the people that tried doing these, whether they are aware or not -- one of the easiest way to deal with it was for me to hand it over to a deity, like Goddess Kali to weed out and punish everyone doing these</strong></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, April 17, 2025 11:31‚ÄØAM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Imagination usually feels light, playful, and under your control, you can start, stop, or change it at will. Ordinary thoughts feel like your own inner voice, often tied to your mood or recent experiences, and they flow logically or chaotically depending on your mind. Genuine intermissions or impressions from entities, however, often feel like they arrive suddenly and independently, carrying a weight, clarity, or ‚Äúotherness‚Äù that isn‚Äôt easy to dismiss; they may interrupt your train of thought, repeat with persistence, or come with sensations (chills, pressure, warmth, ringing in the ears, emotional shifts) that accompany the message. Over time, the main difference is that imagination and thoughts fade easily, while true entity impressions linger, repeat, or affect you in a way you couldn‚Äôt have generated on your own</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1410462689989230642 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1410462689989230642><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 27, 2025 11:15‚ÄØPM">11:15‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> Judging method that is fair </code>

For two parties to judge an astral spar fairly despite having different lenses or biases, both should first agree on the framework: what counts as a ‚Äúhit,‚Äù what signals the end, and what is considered valid defense or offense. During and after the spar, each party should describe their experience in simple, neutral terms, what they saw, felt, or sensed, without immediately assuming their perception is the only correct one. By comparing these notes, overlaps will reveal the shared truth while differences can be understood as personal filters or symbolic translations of the same event. Keeping a respectful, detached attitude and being willing to accept that neither view is complete on its own ensures a fairer judgment, since the goal is not proving who‚Äôs ‚Äúright,‚Äù but building a mutual record of the encounter that accounts for both perspectives</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1410463876830597120 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1410463876830597120><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 27, 2025 11:19‚ÄØPM">11:19‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> How to tell if your altar devotion, prayers and offerings have been accepted by deities or forces </code> 

When a deity or force (angels, demons, deities, whatever else) accepts your devotion, offerings, or prayers, the signs usually come as shifts in atmosphere and resonance, you might feel sudden warmth, chills, peace, or an uplifting presence, or notice the space become still and charged. Subtle synchronicities also appear, like repeated symbols, animals, numbers, dreams, or songs connected to them showing up soon after. Sometimes your offering feels ‚Äúreceived,‚Äù as if the energy leaves it or the act carries weight beyond yourself. Other times it comes as inner confirmation: an unexpected calm, clarity, or joy right after the prayer, or even a quiet but distinct sense of being acknowledged. The difference from imagination is that these moments linger, repeat, and often bring results or patterns that line up with the deity‚Äôs nature, reminding you you‚Äôre in real relationship rather than talking to empty air</span></div></div></div></div></div>

People‚Äôs energy systems and auras differ because everyone is shaped by a mix of their physical health, emotions, mindset, spiritual practices, and even their natural soul makeup.

In astral sparring, the reason some people seem almost unbeatable while others get hit hard comes down to differences in energy structure, awareness, and practice. Some people have naturally dense or well-fortified energy systems, so attacks don‚Äôt really get through, almost like wearing strong armor. Others have trained themselves to channel energy quickly, shield instinctively, or redirect force instead of absorbing it. On the flip side, people with weaker boundaries, less experience, or unhealed energy leaks might take on more damage and feel it strongly. It‚Äôs less about ‚Äúinvincibility‚Äù and more about how someone has built, maintained, and aligned their astral body, like the difference between a seasoned martial artist and a beginner stepping into the ring

It means looking past appearances, ego, and emotional reactions to sense the deeper truth of a situation, a person, or a spiritual encounter. True discernment doesn‚Äôt rush to judgment or cling to what feels convenient, it weighs, tests, and listens with both the mind and the spirit. It‚Äôs steady and often uncomfortable, because it shows you what <em>is</em>, not just what you <em>want</em>. At its highest, discernment isn‚Äôt suspicion or paranoia, but a kind of clarity born from honesty and alignment with your higher self</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1410473756421263444 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1410473756421263444><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 27, 2025 11:59‚ÄØPM">11:59‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> On closed practices </code>

Closed practices are closed for a reason: they‚Äôre bound by lineage, culture, and sacred agreements that protect both the people practicing them and the spirits or deities involved. When someone outside of that context tries to use them, like many do in modern occult spaces on Discord, Telegram, Kik, etc., they often miss key initiations, protections, or understandings that make the practice safe and effective. Without those, the energy can backfire: spirits may reject them, ancestral forces might push back, or the person may stir up forces they can‚Äôt actually handle. What looks like ‚Äújust another spell‚Äù online is often something rooted in generations of lived experience, vows, and spiritual authority. Using it without that framework is like taking medicine without knowing the dosage, it can harm instead of heal, and in the spiritual sense, it can invite chaos instead of power</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1410474182197776496 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1410474182197776496><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 28, 2025 12:00‚ÄØAM">12:00‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> Why alignment matters </code>

Being out of alignment with your true self and higher self can definitely bring chaos to your entire life and spiritual path, because it creates inner conflict where your actions, choices, and energy no longer match your deeper purpose. This misalignment often shows up as confusion, repeating struggles, bad luck with money and countless other things in life, sudden setbacks, toxic patterns, or feeling drained even when you‚Äôre ‚Äúdoing the right things.‚Äù Spiritually, it can block guidance, distort your intuition, and attract situations that force you to confront what you‚Äôve been avoiding. The higher self naturally seeks balance, growth, and authenticity, so when you act against it, whether by denying your needs, clinging to false identities, or ignoring inner truth, the gap between who you are and who you‚Äôre meant to be becomes tension that manifests outward as chaos until you realign</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When it comes to incarnates, fragments, or shards of deities, angels, or demons, and so on, their strength depends on how close they are to their original source and how much energy or essence flows through them. Some are like faint sparks, still carrying the signature of the source but weak, because they‚Äôre far removed, diluted, or only carrying a tiny piece of the whole. Others are more like a beam straight from the sun, drawing directly from the core and holding far more presence, power, or clarity. The difference can come from purpose (some are meant to just carry influence or echoes, not raw power), the channel they move through (a person‚Äôs capacity, devotion, or alignment), and timing, sometimes a shard is quiet until it‚Äôs ‚Äúcalled up‚Äù by circumstances or growth. That‚Äôs why some feel almost powerless while others radiate like the source itself</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1410476384437927976 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1410476384437927976><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 28, 2025 12:09‚ÄØAM">12:09‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>This is something I have also experienced directly, and witnessed through my time on discord, this is my current conclusion</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1410477052578107475 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1410477052578107475><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 28, 2025 12:12‚ÄØAM">12:12‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Now to the one million dollar answer, honestly people don‚Äôt really need to worry if they feel weaker than others, even if they‚Äôre considered the same or similar incarnates, because power and closeness to the source isn‚Äôt a measure of worth or purpose.

Feeling ‚Äúweaker‚Äù can simply mean their shard carries a gentler function, or that their connection hasn‚Äôt fully opened yet, not that they‚Äôre lesser. Just like in a body where every cell is vital, not everyone has to be the heart or the muscle, some are nerves, some are blood, and all are necessary.

Now this might be a heavy topic for many, in the spiritual and occult circles, especially among incarnates and otherkin on discord, things like LARP, main character syndrome, and god complex often blur the line between genuine identity and imaginative roleplay, which is why awareness is key. It‚Äôs perfectly fine, and even empowering, to explore archetypes, channel divine currents, or frame yourself as an incarnate of a deity or spirit, because these roles can help unlock purpose and self-discovery. But the trouble begins when someone loses balance: LARP becomes harmful when imagination is mistaken for absolute truth and used to claim false authority, MC syndrome can twist into dismissing others as ‚Äúless real‚Äù when everyone‚Äôs experience is equally valid, and a god complex becomes destructive if someone believes they‚Äôre literally above others instead of using the archetype as a tool for growth. For incarnates and otherkin especially, strength doesn‚Äôt come from power levels or dramatic titles but from authenticity, integration, and how well you live in alignment with your essence, so while exploring these roles can be healing and transformative; grounding keep them from turning into delusion or harm</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1410478789586063482 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1410478789586063482><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 28, 2025 12:19‚ÄØAM">12:19‚ÄØAM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>After all many starts through LARP it is the gate or I would say the threshold in which many started spirituality in their early days, it can be refined to help for a healthy growth and spirituality, of course I am not encouraging LARP to be carried over for the rest of  someone&#39;s journey in that form, but to constantly transform it</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The way I see it, the difference between placebo and real spiritual experiences is in the depth and impact. Placebo usually feels more like a temporary high, it‚Äôs nice in the moment, maybe it gives comfort or confidence, but it fades quick and doesn‚Äôt really shift you deep inside. Real spiritual stuff, on the other hand, tends to leave a mark. It changes how you think, how you feel about life, and even how you act around people. It can hit you in ways you didn‚Äôt expect, sometimes even uncomfortable at first, but it sticks and keeps unfolding over time. Placebo is more like a sugar rush, while real spiritual work is like a slow, powerful fire that keeps burning and reshaping you even after the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù is over</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1413250386323833009 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1413250386323833009><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, September 4, 2025 3:52‚ÄØPM">3:52‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">How to diminish confirmation bias and frontloading</code> 

Confirmation bias is when your mind automatically looks for signs, answers, or ‚Äúproof‚Äù that line up with what you already believe, while ignoring anything that challenges it. Frontloading is kind of similar, it‚Äôs when you load your expectations ahead of time (like assuming what a tarot card, scan, or spiritual sign must mean before actually experiencing it), which can block you from seeing the truth as it is. To get rid of both, the key is staying neutral. That means going into prayer, scans, or any spiritual practice without forcing a certain outcome, and being open to whatever shows up, even if it‚Äôs not what you want. It also helps to question yourself: <em>‚ÄúAm I seeing this because it‚Äôs really here, or because I want it to be here?‚Äù</em> Balancing it with grounded stuff like journaling, asking for feedback, or testing things over time keeps you from tricking yourself. The more honest and curious you stay, the less your bias runs the show</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1413251533264650324 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1413251533264650324><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, September 4, 2025 3:57‚ÄØPM">3:57‚ÄØPM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">On power scaling and power level issue in the occult</code>

People care a lot about power levels in the occult, especially when it comes to sparring, comparing, or ‚Äúwho‚Äôs stronger‚Äù ?, because it touches on both ego and survival. On one hand, the occult deals with forces that feel invisible but real, so measuring ‚Äúpower‚Äù becomes a way for people to feel safe, respected, and validated in a field where proof is hard to pin down. On the other hand, sparring or comparing strength is like a shortcut for status, if someone is seen as <strong>‚Äústronger,‚Äù</strong> others assume their practice, path, or lineage is more legitimate. It‚Äôs very human, since in regular life people measure worth through money, looks, or success; in the occult, it often shifts into energy, visions, or raw force. But the danger is when it gets too focused on ranking and clashing, the work stops being about healing, wisdom, or growth, and starts becoming about winning and superficial things. That‚Äôs why sparring has to be balanced: it can sharpen skill and reveal blind spots, but if it becomes the only measure, it risks turning spirituality into just another ego battlefield</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>LARPing (pretending / role-playing):</em> this is usually easy to spot because the stories feel over-dramatic, ego-centered, or aimed at impressing others. It‚Äôs more about performance than growth. If someone (or even yourself) is constantly ‚Äúacting powerful‚Äù but nothing actually changes in their life or energy, it leans toward LARP

<em>Schizophrenia or mental health struggles:</em> these can blur the line because symptoms (voices, visions, paranoia) may feel spiritual but they usually come with distress, disorganization, and difficulty functioning in daily life. The experiences don‚Äôt integrate smoothly, they overwhelm. In spiritual experiences, even if intense, there‚Äôs usually some grounding, clarity, and ability to keep living your life

<em>Making things up:</em> this happens when someone wants validation so badly they start filling in the blanks. The clue is when experiences always line up too perfectly with what they expect or wish for. Its frontloading and confirmation bias are mixed together

<em>Genuine spiritual experiences</em>: these tend to carry depth. They leave a lasting impact on how you think, feel, or act. They might surprise you, humble you, or even challenge you, but over time they bring clarity, healing, or growth. They don‚Äôt just fade like a placebo, they echo through your life

UPG can unconsciously amplify your shadow aspects,  ego, fear, resentment, or unresolved trauma, and externalize them as spirits, curses, or ‚Äúenergies&quot;

For example, inner anger may be projected as a ‚Äúmalevolent spirit attacking me&quot;

This keeps a person trapped in fear, feeding the illusion instead of healing the root

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>

When you open yourself through trance, invocation, or channeling without discernment, you may connect with deceptive or parasitic entities, energies that mimic divine voices but drain vitality or sow confusion

Some entities thrive on attention, emotional volatility, or worship

The more you trust them blindly, the deeper their influence becomes

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight"> </code>

Unverified beings (or even your own ego under divine disguise) can manipulate you into actions that harm you or others:

Cutting off friends/family ‚Äúbecause they block your path&quot;

Performing rituals that destabilize your energy

Believing you‚Äôre spiritually superior and rejecting all correction</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, October 6, 2025 7:44‚ÄØPM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>
